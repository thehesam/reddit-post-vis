"Hey r/seo,

Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I launched a new e-commerce website about 20 days ago and have been obsessively watching my Google Search Console. For those wondering, the site is built with a custom Next.js frontend and a MongoDB database. I'm hoping to get some feedback and guidance on my next steps from this amazing community.

So far, all the traffic is 100% organic from Google search. I've done literally nothing else:

 - No ads
 - No inorganic traffic
 - Zero backlinks built
 - No blog posts yet
 - Not a single social media post
 - Haven't even done a ""We are live!"" announcement anywhere.

Here's a snapshot of my GSC performance data:
Last 7 Days:

 - Clicks: 30
 - Impressions: 1.2k
 - CTR: 2.6%
 - Average Position: 20

Last 24 Hours:
This is where it gets interesting and gives me a bit of hope. Things seem to be picking up.

 - Clicks: 8
 - Impressions: 160
 - CTR: 5%
 - Average Position: ~13

A big chunk of this recent boost seems to be from the free merchant listings in the shopping tab, which are performing really well:

 - Merchant Listing Clicks (last 24h): 5
 - Merchant Listing Impressions (last 24h): 34
 - Merchant Listing CTR: 14.7%
 - Merchant Listing Avg. Position: 2.2

Seeing these initial numbers without any promotion feels promising, but I know I'm at the very bottom of the mountain. My domain is brand new, and I have absolutely no authority.

My main questions are:

1.  Given these numbers, what should be my immediate priority? Should I start creating content (blogs), or focus on something else?

2. How do I start building genuine, quality backlinks for a new e-commerce store? I've read a lot about avoiding spammy tactics, but the path to acquiring those first few powerful links seems really daunting. What are some actionable, white-hat strategies for a complete beginner?

I'm ready to put in the work and would appreciate any advice you can throw my way. Thanks in advance!

"Ladies and gentlemen, earlier this month I lost two jobs in just two days. One was an in-person role as a content writer at my city’s municipal government, and the other was a remote SEO assistant position for an affiliate site in the betting industry.

Since then, I’ve been applying for new jobs, and honestly, I don’t see AI as the real threat. The real villain is the in-person model. Around 90% of openings demand it, and convincing employers that I can deliver the same results from home has been tough.

I’m married, my wife is eight months pregnant, we rent our place so no job means nothing coming in. I’ve got a solid portfolio, so that’s not the issue.

At this point, I see two paths: keep pushing for another copywriting role (I even paid for LinkedIn Premium to improve my chances), or launch a new project from scratch.

What’s this project? I live in a coastal capital city in Brazil, and I realized most local hotels barely use social media or even Google My Business (believe it or not).

My idea is to hire a filmmaker and a designer by the day, then go prospecting hotels and offering communication packages (silver and gold). Signing these hotels would bring in quick income (as soon as the contract is closed), while giving me the structure to keep producing material and possibly renewing contracts—or expanding to more clients.

So yeah, I’m stuck. It’s been 24 days without a job, and I keep wondering if this strategy of starting from zero could actually work.

"This is something I've been thinking about and I thought it might be interesting to share.

By now we all understand that AI is here, it's impacted quite a few things, and will do much more over time.

It's concerning for us, especially thinking about the uncertainty of everything. So I wanted to lay out (what I believe) are things we know for sure, and things we don't.

Uncertain:
-How will title tags change
-How will meta descriptions change
-How will linking change
-How will search change
-How will the Internet change

Since we can't control those things, or even make a confident guess, I like to take a step back and try to look at the things we do know.

Certain:
-Businesses will always exist
-Those businesses will always have competition
-Those businesses will need a way to differentiate and gain an edge over their competition

Differentiating and gaining an edge is the result we provide our clients as SEO/marketers. There will always be businesses more willing and eager to do what it takes then the businesses they're competing with. We step in to give them that path.

Although the specific mechanism we use is and always will be changing, the underlying need will always exist.

So I guess my thought is, don't get so tunnel vision on the mechanism, that you forget the purpose and principles driving it.

"Background:
My website has been live for about 10 months, and I'm dealing with a brand recognition issue. My brand name is very similar to a keyword that gets ~2.4k monthly searches (according to Semrush).

Current performance:
* Getting around 2k branded searches monthly (brand name + website address combined)
* Starting to see some traction with organic branded traffic
* Domain is gaining authority but still struggling with brand entity recognition

What I've tried several months ago:
* JSON-LD with Organization and Brand
* Internal linking with brand mentions
* Backlinks with proper brand anchor text
* Optimized title tags and meta descriptions with brand name
* Created dedicated ""About"" page and footer branding

"I have been looking to start servicing more bilingual clients.

Specifically French and Spanish speaking.

I come from a French speaking family myself and I realized creating content in different languages can be very messy…. 

That led me to look into French SEO best practices to see if it would be best to mirror the site in French or just rely on localization.

Ending up just duplicating an existing page to French to see.

OMG It was a ALOT…. 

Besides having to change some of the formatting because the different CTA’s and text were too long or too short and ruined the layout,

Translating the content (whether on my own or tools) actually looked like having to rewrite it so it flowed more and caught the cultural nuances.

And then, If I wanted the content to translate cleanly I had to change the tone and word choice I used in English.

It was more than double the work. Im contemplating hiring a bilingual content creator, possibly also a developer to just own this stuff.

"Hi there. I am looking for advice on determining the type of algorithm penalty is on my site. I will start by saying: 1. I have never bought a backlink 2. I have never worked with an SEO  3. It's confirmed that I have no tech errors. Basically, I have lost thousands of Google clicks per day since 2022 so I know there is some type of algorithmic penalty on my domain. I have never received any manual action.

I know that most say not to worry about backlinks because Google disregards spammy links, but there is definitely a correlation between the rise in referring domains and my lost of all traffic over a 2-3 year time span.   
  
I am more worried about penalties resulting from violating Google's spam policy. According to their website, they punish for link spam which violates their policies. It says this includes: paying for links to manipulate search rankings, low end directory sites, and using automated programs to create links. 

I have been tracking my links on: GSC, Bing Webmaster Tools, Semrush, and Ahrefs for many years. I know many have said to only trust the links found by Google and Bing. The links are different in each system.   
  
So, I have a question about several links from different sources. Are any of these possibly causing a penalty and what should I do about it? 

1. I have 100,000+ links from a local real estate site. They basically increase with each new listing. Basically, the real estate site put a link to our article with the exact title in their navigation bar. This link shows in GSC, but not Bing. 

2. I have hundreds of directory/guest post site links. These show up in Semrush and Ahrefs, but not GSC or Bing. These sites are really spammy looking but have a domain authority of 50-70, occasionally lower but mostly on the higher end. It's basically a page with an unending list of 1-3 million domains. Each site uses the same layout. Pay $75 for 1 link or $500 to list your website on all 30. My site is added to new directories on a recurring basis. Not sure who is paying to list me on these sites as I don't rank in Search anymore. Would Google be punishing me because someone is setting up some type of automated link program?

3. A bunch of gibberish content pages with links to a lot of sites within a big wall of text. I don't know what this is but I have dozens of these links in Bing. It appears that they are entering in anchor text which matches my article title or keywords that I am trying to rank for.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m more an SEO writer than expert so need a little guidance. I have done all I need to do to switch from Squarespace to WordPress. Copied content like for like including metas, alt text headings etc. I&amp;#39;ve set the URLs up to be like for like as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using Hostinger to host and I&amp;#39;ve used GoDaddy for my domain for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to transfer the domain, rather keep it with GoDaddy and point it to WP/Hostinger in the same way I pointed it to my Squarespace account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips, best practices, or clear guidelines on what the heck I should be doing lol?&lt;/p&gt;

"Hi, I'm looking for some help.

My website for my SaaS is having issues with Google. It ranks first in all other search engines Bing, DuckDuckGo etc. if I search ""tufa io"".

For Google, a few times when I have pushed an update to the site and we get recrawled, we then rank first for our domain name for a couple of days and then we disappear off the search result (not ranked low, just not ranked at all). 

Doing a ""site:..."" search does appear so we are indexed. There are no Security Issues or Manual Actions on Search Console. We have canonical pages correctly set up. I have audited it and everything seems to be set up correctly. We are releasing regular updates (which are crawled) as well as new blog posts.

We did migrate from an old URL 6 months ago. We have permanent redirects set up and used Google Site migration tool to migrate.

As far as I can tell we are doing everything correctly, Google seems to be a black box with no contact point in terms of it's search functionalities. My only conclusions could be:

* There is a removal request we don't know about affecting our traffic
* A previous owner of our domain had dodgy content and we are penalised
* There is some kind of hidden penalty on Google for our domain.

I find it very odd that we intermittently rank then disappear. Any help is much appreciated.

"Hey everyone,

So I have been learning SEO for a few months now and honestly I am still confused about some basic stuff. Like when you find a good keyword, how do you actually know how many backlinks you need to rank for it? And what is the minimum DA score you need?

Also if your content and the keyword do not match well enough to rank, how do you decide which keyword to focus on instead? Like based on your current DA score and other factors. I wanted to know if anyone have did this properly and can share some tips. I have been trying different approaches but nothing seems to work consistently.

I don't need anything super fancy and I have done a decent amount of research and I'm fairly sure I want to build it on wordpress with bookingpress.

Any recommendations for other options for sites, hosts, dev options, anything, will be greatly appreciated.
I'm sure I don't want a platform like squarespace as I like the idea of having more control/ownership over my website from the beginning as I wouldn't like the fuss of moving/changing/building it again elsewhere if the time comes I need a better option.

My website doesn't need to be anything special right now at all really, just pretty basic to get me going. Just need a booking and payment system for a new business I'm starting as a weekend side hustle. Maybe some options to embed and link to social media, online reviews and potentially other larger platforms if (hopefully as) my business grows 🤞🏼 
I'd like the booking system seperate so if there's a reason I need to move my website I don't need to remake the whole part of that process and can easily just embed it from elsewhere (bookingpress seems pretty versatile for that but again happy for any recommendations/suggestions/advice).

My last question would be just in respect to wordpress I've seen some issues with security. Is that a big issue with wordpress or something easily remedied with a good security packet and again (sorry all the agains) any specific advice in this area related to wordpress or other recommendations will be greatly appreciated.

I’ve noticed that Google’s AI Overview tends to appear more often when I search with long-tail queries or full questions, compared to shorter, more generic keywords.

To me, this suggests that focusing heavily on long-tail keywords might be less effective than it used to be. It also seems that websites with lower authority (that typically struggle to rank for short, competitive keywords) are more affected by AI Overviews, while high-authority sites targeting short keywords seem less impacted.

"Tl/dr - rankings have returned for a brand new Google news source site that was hit after the 2025 June Core update.

This is a small update to a post I made regarding losing rank and slow indexing after the June Core update. 

Niche news website became a real Google News ""source"" on June 28th 2025. The site was 15 months old at the time. This was not easy to do as most SEO experts know. Becoming a true google news site is a lot of work, making sure everything is done correctly. 

Anyway, for a week we watched many of our Articles finally appear on Google News and rank really well. We started appearing on Top Stories and the site grew for a week! Then on July 4th around 4pm all our Articles dropped out of the top spots! Nothing ranked higher than page 3.

We would even search the website name and nothing would appear for a few pages. We did not lose any ranking on Google Search, or Discover, and we would still appear in Top Stories, but our Gnews died!

I checked out competition and of the top 10 sites,  5 of us we all affected the same way. The top site in our industry wouldn't rank past page 3 on Gnews. Weird articles from 5 years ago and all from the same sites would take up pages and pages.

This has to be related to the June 2025 Core update.

The advice of not changing a darn thing, just keep putting out articles like we have been was the best advice! 

After 7 weeks things are starting to settle down and our Articles are again appearing on page one and even ranking #1 again. It appears as Google re-indexes the site more and more of our Articles are appearing again. 

Even our new articles are instantly being indexed. Our Google News impressions and clicks are again growing. Not by much, but even the little bit is good news. Even our regular Google Search is showing our Articles ranked higher.

We may hit 100k unique clicks for the month of August. Our impressions have gone up to 4.2 million.

"I’ve been working with a herb client for about 6 months now. The site started with a Domain Rating of 9 and very little organic traction. Since then, we’ve published around 70 blog posts (a mix of transactional + informational content), targeting both low KD and higher KD keywords.

"Hi, we updated our shop 3 months ago, and since then I have been closely monitoring Google search results.

We have **two languages, /de and /en.** When you visit exampleurl, you are redirected to exampleurl/de or exampleurl/en accordingly.

The main language is DE.

Our canonical code is:

&lt;link rel=""canonical"" href=""exampleurl/de/""&gt;  
&lt;link rel=""alternate"" href=""exampleurl/de/"" hreflang=""de""&gt;  
link rel=""alternate"" href=""exampleurl/en/"" hreflang=""en""&gt;

According to Google Search Console, exampleurl/de is NOT indexed!

The status is  
“Page is not indexed: Duplicate, **Google chose different canonical** than user”

Google-selected canonical: exampleurl

And in SEMRush, it shows some of our backlinks as “Lost,” with the note “Target URL doesn't match a canonical URL. The canonical tag could have been removed.” The backlink points to exampleurl/de/

Do I have to improve anything, or is it okay as it is?

"Hey everyone, I need some advice on domain strategy.

I’m building a new platform. The ideal domain I want (exact match of the main search query people use) is already taken, and the owner wants $10k for it. Problem is, that exact search query is about **10x more popular** than any other variation.

For example (just an example, not the real name):

* My competitor has *TrainingGenerator  com*
* I could register *TrainingGenerator  ai*
* Or I could create a totally different branded name like *Tranero  com* (and still optimize all blog content around “Training Generator”).

The tricky part: my competitor isn’t really doing much. His site has only 6 pages, no backlinks, no promotion, no content. But since he owns the exact match 'com' TLD, I’m worried that if I blow up with backlinks and traffic, he could later jump in and ride the wave because people will naturally type in the .com.

So my question is:

* Would you go with '`ai' TLD` since it’s tech-related and growing in acceptance? (and I'm using AI on it)
* Or would you go with a completely unique brand name (random word style), even though it’s not the exact keyword?

"Yesterday I talked with a B2B marketplace founder with $15mln+ ARR.

He shared an idea on AI visibility tracking that I hadn't even thought of.

To be honest, I'm even ashamed that I didn't think of it before.

He said that they don't track their brand visibility using any of the huge list of existing AI visibility tools, because the methods of prompting such tools use are inaccurate.

The only right way he found is:

1/ Record and transcribe all the discovery calls with potential customers.

2/ Enter the summary of the call as a prompt into AI chats and check whether your brand is mentioned as the best potential solution in such a situation.

This is so simple and so genius. And I feel this is the most accurate way for B2B startups to track their visibility now.

"hi guys,

I’ve been looking around for SEO tools that can help with real-time SERP analysis and competitor research, but I haven’t found anything that does exactly what I’m imagining.

Specifically, I’m thinking about a tool that could:

* Pull questions from places like Reddit, Quora, and People Also Ask (PPA).
* Analyze competitor content to see things like word count, headings, images, internal/external links, and content gaps.
* Generate fully optimized articles based on that data, covering all the important aspects that Google and AI engines look for.
* Also help with auto-publishing and schema markup for better SEO performance.

My question: Is there any existing tool that already combines all of these features? Or is there something close to it?

"Hi everyone,

I’m working with a lawyer who has an online reputation challenge. When you search their name, one of the first results is a disciplinary hearing notice from their law society. While it doesn’t reflect their full career or the quality of their work, it ranks high because the source is such an authoritative site.

Our plan so far is to publish press releases, build professional profiles, write guest articles, and create new web pages under their name to push stronger, positive content higher in the results.

I’d love to hear your thoughts — is there anything else you’d recommend, or a specific strategy you’ve found effective in this kind of situation?

"Hi All,

I’ve been doing SEO for a few years now, and one recurring challenge I face is clients not fully understanding what I do. I always try to break things down in “simple” terms, explaining both what I’m doing and why - but usually, a few months later, the same questions resurface.

To solve this, I’m planning to create a client portal where they can log in and see different aspects of my work. Features I’m considering to include:

* Dashboard
* Notifications for major changes
* Messaging system
* Strategy and goals
* Work log and project timelines
* Content planner
* Keyword rankings
* Competitor snapshots
* Education hub
* Google Profile optimisation
* Reports and file uploads

My hope is that this will give clients clear visibility into what I’m working on and when, as long as they make use of the portal. (On my end, I’ll also be able to see when they log in, which should help with accountability.)

My question to you is: are there any features you think I should add?

"We've been impacted by huge declining rankings due to HCU and Spam updates for the last 18-24 months.

Decided to take massive action and cull 200 unrelated blog posts (of 350 total) leaving 150 good related articles.

And cut about 50 pages from our suburb local pages as they were largely duplicate content (suburb, suburb North, suburb south)

Did this 8 weeks ago, so just before the last core update. 

We've expectedly tanked in the rankings, loosing page 1 for anything and thus all our organic traffic.

I expected to be destroyed for 4-6 weeks while Google was re-evaluating our site, but we are now at week 8 and theres still no sign of recovery. 

Does anyone have any insight on how long recovery from this can take?

"Hey folks,

I’ve been trying to improve my site’s performance and ran into something confusing. On **PageSpeed Insights**, my **Core Web Vitals Assessment is showing as Failed** (screenshot attached). LCP is around **2s**, CLS is **0.11**, and TTFB is **0.9s**.

But when I test the same site on **GTmetrix**, the results look fantastic – LCP under 1s, CLS = 0, and everything else green.

From what I understand, PSI uses **CrUX (real-world field data)** while GTmetrix is **lab data in ideal conditions**. But I’m stuck on how to bridge that gap.

1. **How can I diagnose what’s dragging my CrUX (field) data down?**
2. **What tools or workflows** (beyond PSI &amp; GTmetrix) can help me track and fix this for real users?
3. For anyone who’s been through this: Did you fix it by tackling **hosting, CDN, caching, or frontend issues** like image preloading/fonts/layout shifts?

"I recently launched a project called PassTIA — it’s a SaaS platform I built for IT students who are preparing for their CompTIA certifications (A+, Security+, etc.). The idea is to provide practice exams, hands-on environments, and learning resources at an affordable price.

I’ve been working on building out the SEO side, but since it’s a niche market, I want to make sure I’m heading in the right direction. Here’s what I’ve done so far:

Added keywords around “CompTIA practice exams,” “CompTIA A+ simulator,” etc.

Set up a blog where I post content about IT certifications, study tips, and troubleshooting guides.

Basic on-page SEO (title tags, meta descriptions, H1/H2s, alt text).

Submitted the site to Google Search Console and working on indexing issues.

1. How can I target certification exam keywords without being drowned out by the big platforms (ExamCompass, Udemy, etc.)?


2. What kind of blog strategy works best for SEO in this niche — should I go for long-form tutorials, comparison guides, or quick study tips?

"Hi there! I've chimed in here before about my SEO work as a non-expert. I run a video production company in Boston and dove into SEO April 2024. We've seen awesome growth in terms of clicks to our site and conversions all at the hands of SEO which has been super exciting. 

I plan to continue on this path - writing a few blogs a week and so forth. I've also been getting about 3-5 backlinks / month for the last 6 months and plan to continue to do that. I should mention that I wouldn't want this person managing H1s, H2s or meta titles because I think I really have those on lock. I've done a year of A/B testing there and have dialed that in!

Again - I would keep up the content pace that I have going and all the things I'm already doing but would having someone else in the back end who is an expert help? I suppose I want to know what they'd actually do to help supplement SEO. What are some things I could ask this person to do? 

I'm thinking I want to invest in an expert because, if i'm not mistaken, last week we were ranking in the 1/2 spot for ""video production in Boston"". We got 15+ form submissions in a week and it was unreal. If I could always have that kind of engagement / leads I would pay a lot for that!

"End of the month rolls around and I feel like I’m less of an SEO and more of a report builder.

The routine is always the same

GA4 for traffic/conversions

Search Console for queries/impressions

Ahrefs/Semrush for backlinks + keyword movements

Maybe a Data Studio dashboard if the client insisted

Then hours in PowerPoint/Google Docs making it look presentable

What drives me mad is that clients barely check the dashboards we set up. They’ll log in once, then still ask for the end-of-month PDF.

The kicker? Connectors break all the time. GA4 or Search Console decides not to sync, and now I’m re-exporting CSVs and reformatting charts at 11pm the night before delivery.

Feels like I spend more time patching reports than actually working on SEO strategy.

Curious — how do you all handle client reporting?

Stick with Data Studio/Looker dashboards?

Manual exports into Sheets/Docs?

Or have you found a system that doesn’t make you dread reporting week?

"Hello everyone. I’ve been running a social media tools website for 10 years. I had never been hit so hard by a Google update as with this one. I’ve lost 70% of my traffic to the point where keywords I used to rank #1 for are now sitting at position 20 or worse.

My SEO strategy has always been optimized content, 100% core web vitals, keyword density in the text, and backlinks with anchor text targeting the keywords I cared about (and their variations). For 10 years this worked very well, I was always ranking first for almost all the keywords I set as my goal.

"Hello all,

I am working on a WordPress affiliate link website for a client, it is 3 weeks that we are live.  
We started great, good impressions, we have 40 to 50 pages as of now. Desktop performance is perfect, mobile not the best, but a good ratio of customer comes from desktop.

We started having peak of impressions that went high then to 0 for a couple of days and back up again, it happened 3 times now.  
The only issue we found from logs are a few pages that gives both status 200 and 301, robots.txt and homepage too, the only redirect rules we have are from HTTP to HTTPS and from www to non-www.

I am just a humble developer and I am no expert, they are telling me these peaks in impressions are extremely odd and never seen before in a new website.

I am still checking everywhere and contacting hosting support and annoy them to re-check the server for issues, but nothing is coming up, I am going crazy!

"Hey everyone, I have a question that I was wondering if anyone here could help with.

I own a service company, I'll use the example of a shed builder in st louis missouri. Let's say for example my companies name is STL Sheds. When i type my company name in on google using an ipad or a labtop my gbp page pops up on the right hand side and on the left is a bunch of unrelated websites and you cant find much else about me other then the google page. Even worse is that if you type in STL SHEDS on an iphone it doesnt come up at all.

1.Change business name to stl shed builders because for some reason if i type that in all of the information for my company pops up

"My site was doing well at the start of 2025, then suddenly tanked just as a load of toxic backlinks started pointing at it. A competitor even tried to buy my domain late last year; I turned them down, and a few months later this spam wave started. Now GSC shows “no data” for links, Ahrefs is full of junk, and I’m stuck wondering if this is negative SEO or just bad timing.

From March onwards I saw a big surge of new referring domains in Ahrefs; most of them are obviously toxic (PBN sellers, expired domain spam, auto-generated junk). By July/August, my organic traffic had basically fallen off a cliff, and it lines up almost exactly with the spike in backlinks.

Google Search Console shows no linking sites at all, so maybe Google is ignoring them? I’ve already uploaded a disavow file with the worst ones and I’m updating it as more come in. No manual actions flagged in GSC.

So my questions are:

* Could this actually be negative SEO from a competitor (i.e. someone blasting my site with spam links)?
* If GSC isn’t showing any of these links, is it more likely some sort of algorithm filter/quality issue rather than backlinks being counted?
* Other than monitoring, disavowing, and trying to build stronger legit links, is there anything else I can actually do?

"Hey everyone,
I’m currently building a website for my local home services business. Right now, I’ve written about 50 optimized pages targeting different queries.

&lt;p&gt;I do not like the current formatting of my H1, so rather than change it to H1, I created a rule in my Shopify Theme that a duplicated H1 that is hidden. So now, I have a visible h3 product title, and an identical H1 Hidden product title. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is having a Hidden h1 detrimental? - ie Google perception spammy? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it better to just keep a H3 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to change my h1 formatting so I change it to a visible h1, but with the formating of a h3? &lt;/p&gt;

"I've gone from top 5 ranking on my best keywords to page 3, and for most key phrases, they don't appear at all, when they used to be on page 1.

My site has 1000s of pages. Lots of ""thin"" content because they are just pictures. There are some duplicate titles, because there are bound to be similar images.

But otherwise I think I've followed all the SEO practices. Over the past 18 months there have been cliffs. I had another 20% drop of traffic between June and July. I normally don't suffer summer declines. Traffic is 50% of what it was this time last year.

I have 80 ""Top linking sites"", I don't know if that is high or low. Sounds low.

My competition is blowing me away this year. I'm beside myself.

I do run ads on the site, but if I don't have ads then there really is no point for me to have a site.

My questions are, assuming you have enough info:  
1) is it possible to save a site once it has crashed?  
2) like I said, I follow on the standard SEO practices, what else is there?  
3) the site is plain php, if I switch to WordPress, would that help?

"Hello r/ SEO, I'm quite new to this world and I'm still learning as I go. Long story short, I recently created a website that is similar to KnowYourMeme, but focused on local content from my country. I track down the origins of memes or general internet humor and write posts about them.

2. Where to keep meta-tags: I heard that I should prioritize GMT (Google Meta Tags) over WordPress. This is the opposite as google/AI told me.

3. Screaming Frog: It was the first time I heard about this term, it is a website crawler to help identify technical SEO issues.



On top of that, I would like to understand the role of SEO specialist and how to collaborate properly in a fair way, are these assumptions correct/fair?

\- Audit the website, detect flaws and bad tag management

\- Fix non indexed pages

\- Organize HTML structure on page

\- Review backlinks for authority

\- Create Meta Titles and Description (so does it means that the SEO specialist will go through all the website, adding meta titles and descriptions in all pages/products/articles?

  
2. On my (contractor) side:

\- Grant access to SEMrush, WordPress, Google SC, direct contact with the developers

\- Create the content internally, with the specialists in the topic

\- PR (Public Relationship) for back links, that means, we will get in touch with many partners to ask them to link us on their webpage.

\- Provide graphics, videos and marketing materials.

  
3. On the partnership:

\- Is 3/6 months enough to structure a webpage? 

\- Objectives: how much of organic search and visibility improvement should we aim to? I ask this because I want to understand how to validade the work.

 \- there are the foundational and proven basics that matter



The problem

Most SEO tools throw 200+ checks at you. For beginners like me, it’s overwhelming. You need an expert to tell you what’s truly critical vs. what’s just “nice to have.”

I'm trying to find a bare-minimum set of +/-15 technical essentials every site should hit before worrying about custom content audit and SEO. If these are done, I'll be safe on the technical side and can focus on content, backlinks, and growth. My goal is to write down a technical SEO textbook to follow each time I start a new project.



Draft 15 Technical SEO Essentials I found for now:

\- Missing or Duplicate &lt;title&gt; Tags – Ensure every page has a unique, descriptive title.

\- Missing or Multiple &lt;h1&gt; Tags – Only one clear main heading per page.

\- Missing or Duplicate Meta Descriptions – Unique, engaging descriptions for each page.

\- Broken Internal Links (404s) – Fix dead links to improve UX and crawlability.

\- Slow Mobile Performance (CLS, LCP, FCP) – Optimize for Core Web Vitals on mobile.

\- Low Word Count (Thin Content) – Encourage sufficient, relevant content per page.

\- No Keyword in Title or H1 – Include target keyword naturally in main elements.

\- Meta Title/Description Length Issues – Prevent truncation or underuse in SERPs.

\- Duplicate Content Detected – Avoid multiple pages competing for the same query.

\- Redirect Chains or Loops – Reduce hops to improve speed and crawl efficiency.

\- Sitemap Not Referenced in robots.txt – Help crawlers discover all important URLs.

\- Missing Structured Data – Enable rich results with schema org markup.

\- Missing Alt Text on Images – Add descriptive alt attributes to improve accessibility and image search context.

\- Missing or Invalid XML Sitemap – Ensure sitemap.xml exists, is valid, and updated.

\- Accidental noindex on Key Pages – Remove unintended noindex directives blocking important URLs.



Questions:

What do you think should be a part of a technical SEO textbook for each new website?

What’s your technical baseline every site should meet before focusing on anything else?

Would you replace, remove, or add anything to this list?

**TL;DR:** I kept wasting time turning Google Search Console data into weekly growth reports (Looker Studio connectors, Sheet formulas, broken filters…). So I built a lightweight tool that takes your GSC **Dates** tab as a CSV and instantly plots clean weekly charts.   
  
Link: [https://seowise.io/tools/gsc-weekly-report](https://seowise.io/tools/gsc-weekly-report)

**Why I made it**  
  
I just wanted quick, consistent **weekly** charts for clicks, impressions. 

**How it works (90 seconds):**

1. In GSC → Performance (Search results) → **Export** → **Google Sheets**
2. Open the sheet, go to the **Dates** tab
3. **File → Download → Comma-separated values (.csv)**
4. Upload that CSV here → [https://seowise.io/tools/gsc-weekly-report](https://seowise.io/tools/gsc-weekly-report)

**What you get**

* Automatic **weekly aggregation** with clean charts for trends (no Looker setup)

* Simple WoW view to spot lifts/dips at a glance
* Nice, presentation-friendly visuals you can screenshot or drop in decks
* Can even add annotations.

"Everyone’s talking about the Cloudflare–Perplexity dust-up like it’s just about scraping rights or protecting publishers. The real story is likely about whether AI agents are going to be treated as a normal part of the web, or as freeloaders that need to be tolled and throttled.

Cloudflare’s new AI crawler rules are being sold as “safeguards.” In practice, they look a lot like setting up a toll booth. Perplexity’s pushback was pretty simple, their agents are just acting on behalf of real people. Charge the agent, you’re basically charging the person using it.

**What isn’t getting enough attention is the quality of this traffic.** 

Right now AI referrals are still small, maybe half a percent to 10% of organic visits depending on the site but they convert way better than traditional search clicks. I**n some cases, AI users are 5–10x more likely to do what the site actually wants them to do.** These are people who’ve already narrowed down what they want before they ever hit the link.

Here’s a curious detail: in Cloudflare’s own press release (from July 1st), **almost no major AI agent company is named as agreeing** to the new rules, except from Linkup an AI-native search engine.

If the idea is to “protect” the open web, setting up tolls and roadblocks might have the opposite effect. We’ve seen this this before in other industries the harder you clamp down, the more you get stealth crawling, proxy hopping, and wasted resources on both sides.

"Hi all-- I wanted to see if anyone else has had this issue.

We made a site in Framer for a client, and we submitted it to Google Search Console. We can see Google is indexing the page when we go to GSC, but something is clearly going on since we cannot find the site when Googling even when googling the site URL in quotes.

"Hey SEO folks, I’m trying to figure out the smartest way to handle my Google My Business situation.

I have a service-based business that was established in NJ for several years, building strong local traction. Around 30–50% of my clients come from out-of-state, primarily CA but also a few others like NC, FL, etc.

I’ve recently relocated to a new state and a couple months ago, anticipating my move, updated my website SEO to include multiple service locations, as well as updating the original GMB listing.

**Questions I have:**
* Should I create a **new GMB listing** for my new location while keeping the old one?
* Would it make sense to create additional GMB listings targeting key out-of-state regions where clients come from? (for example… The Healing Narrative — Denver Homeopathy or The Healing Narrative — LA Homeopathy)
* Or is it better to **stick with one listing** and optimize it for multi-state reach? (which IDK it feels like this doesn't work, pretty sure I don’t rank as high in parts of CA as I do in NJ for instance)
* Are there **risks of confusing Google** or harming SEO when managing multiple locations for a single business?

"Hey r/SEO community,
I'm currently managing a website that was originally built on WordPress by a web developer, but that project is wrapping up, and I'm taking over. To be honest, web development isn't necessarily my area of expertise (I'm more so in charge of managing the overall online presence) and this kind of got added onto my plate of tasks. I know ideally I should know coding, but for now, I'd have to relearn a ton just to make basic changes. We're planning to expand the site with more pages, content, and features down the line, so for ease of use, I'm considering migrating everything over to Wix, since it seems super user-friendly for non-coders like me.
Has anyone here made a similar switch? Would you recommend it from an SEO perspective? I'm worried about potential downsides like limited customization for meta tags, backlinks, or integrating advanced SEO tools. On the flip side, Wix has built-in analytics and SEO features that might make life easier without needing plugins.
If not Wix, what alternatives would you suggest that balance simplicity with strong SEO capabilities? Things like Squarespace, Webflow, or something else? We're definitely going to need solid support for webpage analytics, SEO optimization, backlinks, and easy meta tag editing as we grow.
Any insights, reasons to stick with WP (maybe with a page builder plugin?), horror stories, or success tips would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance!

I need a suggestion.

We're currently migrating a website with a new design and updated content.

On our website, URLs are listed without a trailing slash (e.g - abc dot com, but in Google Search Console, the indexed URLs include a trailing slash (e.g - abc dot com/)\*\*.

"Caveat: One man shop and not full-time SEO. Have done it irregularly for 20 years but not a dedicated practitioner that whole time (just some of the time). I provide this caveat because I'm trying to get around investing in an expensive tool to do this since its just for one client with a smaller budget.

The goal: a topic cluster gap analysis based on what Google associates our site with and what we want to be associated with.

Here's what I did:

A search query data dump from Google Search Console. I did this via a Looker export so to get around the 1000 row export limit.

I loaded this file into an AI tool (not chatgpt but not going to name it b/c this is not a veiled marketing post). I asked for it to output up to 25 2-3 word themes weighted by frequency of occurrence.

I then asked the same AI tool to scrape my client's site and identify up to 25 themes as well. I recognize right here its already a limitation but I figured the AI tool would crap out if I gave it a larger sitemap. I also figured that whatever the homepage and first degree navigation it found probably contained the most important themes anyway (e.g. product/solution pages).

Then I asked it to create the gap analysis to find what themes found on our site are not being detected in GSC data. I think it gave a pretty good starting point (with some irrelevant outliers like ""privacy policy"").

Think this is a decent approach or did I make a faulty assumption?

Lately I’ve been noticing that more and more people are getting answers from AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini instead of Googling.

Got me wondering how do you even track if your website is being cited or mentioned in those AI answers?

Do you just manually ask questions and check?

Or have you built some kind of system?

Or maybe you’re not tracking it at all?

I’ve been digging into this problem because it feels like the “SEO for AI” space is going to be huge. I’m experimenting with some ways to monitor AI visibility, but curious what others here are doing (if anything).

"Just want to kill this over-parrotted Myth once and for all. 

I'll let Perplexity explain it 

People do not need to write in a special way for a large language model (LLM) like Perplexity to understand them because LLMs are trained on vast amounts of real-world text and are specifically designed to process ordinary, natural language input.

LLMs such as Perplexity, Gemini, ChatGPT learn by analyzing billions of word sequences from diverse sources—including conversational text, books, web pages, and social media—which enables them to recognize the patterns, structures, and contexts of everyday language. This means they are adept at predicting the next word or phrase in a sentence based on what people commonly say or write, regardless of spelling mistakes or colloquial grammar.

Key factors that make special writing unnecessary:

* **Pattern Matching:** LLMs use statistical techniques to determine what words or sentences are most likely to follow based on prior context, making them robust to ambiguity, casual speech, and varying syntax.
* **Context Awareness:** Advanced models consider long-range dependencies in text, so they understand meaning from incomplete, run-on, or casually structured sentences.
* **Training Data Diversity:** Because they are trained on naturally occurring language, they can interpret idiomatic expressions, slang, and even minor typographical errors.

In practice, this means users can interact with LLMs just as they would with another person, providing input without the need for formal grammar, explicit structure, or technical vocabulary, and still be clearly understood.

It is only in highly technical or ambiguous queries that some minimal clarification or context may be helpful for optimal results, but this is generally true for any form of communication and not specific to LLM",r/SEO,2025-08-11T17:33:36.000Z,post,Meta,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just want to kill this over-parrotted Myth once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;

"I noticed 3 differences:

1/ You have to spend more time looking for valuable, not popular keywords, because you already have a lot of backlinks, and it's easy for you to start ranking in the top 10 with them.

It's hard because when you have a lot of traffic, you usually don't want to think about small things.

2/ You have to allocate time to think about how you can use existing data for SEO. In most cases, big brands have a lot of interesting data that can be used in product-led SEO or programmatic SEO.

3/ You have spent more time on reputation management. Usually, there are many different variations of brand keywords, and often, you don't control the SERP with some of these keywords.

Sometimes, it's bad reviews about the brand. Sometimes it's keywords related to new features or how-to use guides the brand released, and you don't have content about it yet.

What would you add? 

P.S. ""Big brand"" is a debatable definition. Is this calculated only by share of the market or amount of traffic, or amount of indexed pages?

"Hello everyone,

I created a new one-page WordPress site (home page + four subpages), configured it with YOAST SEO, and submitted it to Google for indexing.  
Everything worked perfectly, and the site was visible.

A little later, I registered another domain under which an independent IT platform is operated. The two URLs are not related in any way, except that they were registered with the same registrar.  
Shortly thereafter, the new URL appeared in Google search results with the page description of the old (!) page. When you clicked on the entry, you were taken to the new page (just a login screen).

I then added noindex headers to the new URL and “blocked” it on Google, which removed the search entry for the home page from Google; the other four pages can still be found.  
And now the old home page is no longer indexed by Google, with the following error message:

Page is not indexed: Duplicate, Google chose different canonical than user

"I’ve just taken on a new SEO client (UK-based trade supply company) whose previous “SEO” provider seems to have done some seriously dodgy work. They’ve built backlinks from unrelated foreign gambling sites,  some via guest posts, some reciprocal, and others just totally random. There’s no relevance at all to the client’s industry.

According to Semrush:

* The site gained **170 backlinks in a single day**, which raises obvious red flags.
* Around **25% of the backlink profile is marked as toxic**.
* The rest aren’t flagged as toxic but are still irrelevant and clearly low-quality.

So far, I’ve:

* Deleted all the dodgy guest posts from the website.
* Created a disavow file based on what I could see in Semrush.
* Started improving on-site content to align better with the client’s actual offering.

**The problem is:**

* I haven’t been given access to Google Search Console yet (still chasing the previous agency).
* The GA4 account I’ve been given access to only started collecting data in early July, so I’ve got no historical visibility.

**My questions:**

1. How risky is it to proceed with an SEO campaign without knowing if there’s a manual action in GSC?
2. Is this kind of backlink spam enough to warrant a new domain, or is it recoverable with cleanup and patience? **Is it worth just starting again with a brand new website?** 
3. Beyond disavow and on-site improvements, what would you do next to help rebuild trust?
4. Does running Google Ads alongside a spammy backlink history pose any risks?

"Google recently made a statement that AI Overviews haven’t reduced clicks — and that in fact, the “quality of clicks” has improved, even if impressions have gone up. They say clicks are still strong and stable across billions of queries.

That sounds reassuring… but I’m curious what people here are actually seeing in the real world.

* Impressions up (especially for info-heavy content)
* CTR down on several pages
* Clicks mostly flat, or slightly down on some

It doesn’t seem catastrophic, but I can’t ignore the shift. Some other SEOs I know have mentioned the same — more visibility but less engagement.

Could this all be niche-dependent? Or is it just early days and we’re still adjusting?

* Are clicks steady or declining?

"Hello, everybody!

In April of this year, I worked on the website SEO for a company. Since the birth of AI, it has become possible for one person to have a powerful and comprehensive team, as I can hire various types of assistants and deploy intelligent agents focused on specific functions.

At the same time, due to the improvement in search engine capabilities, the matching mechanism has shifted from keyword matching to search intent matching. For users, a wider variety of ""search keywords"" in the search box can now match results. Therefore, the previous ""SEO"" optimization has evolved into ""SIO"" optimization.

Thus, I began to think: under these changes, what is the ""gold key"" that can most effectively boost website traffic?

After much consideration, I have focused on content research, providing users with useful and helpful content. In terms of the website, this means writing articles.

"(I'm not selling anything, wondering if my idea is good)

I want to build a tool to help with SEO. It is going to utilise AI. But not in the way everyone else is doing. Hear me out:

* You log into the tool and connect your website
* The tool pulls in all your content
* You select some content you want the tool to ""manage"" and hit ""Ok""
* The tool looks as GA4 ask sees what current average traffic is
* The tool asks you what kind of % increase in traffic you want/expect in next 3-6 months, you tell it
* Then the tool sits back and manages you content in the background 

But what is it doing?

* It periodically checks the traffic for the blog, from GA4, and the timeframe (""1 week in"")
* It reasons ""is this blog gaining traffic as we expect?"")
* If yes it does nothing
* If no the clever stuff kicks off
   * It has a set of tools it can use to improve the on-page SEO
   * Things like check title, slug, meta tags
   * Things like image alt tags
   * Things like ""Are their any broken links?""
   * Or ""Are their enough internal links?""

   * If the title could be better optimised it is done
   * If it find a broken link it replaces it with another suitable link
* It carries on checking traffic
* If the traffic is still not increasing then it can adjust the keyword for something more like to rank, and reoptimise the copy

"Hey everyone, 

  
I have been doing marketing for the last 10 years. As an entrepreneur, I build all my own websites, seo, sem, optimization, audits, everything. I've hired consultatns in the past, never get anything worth the price so I keep doing it myself, while running the busienss.   
  
I'm in the medical field and we are in a highly competitive niche.   
  
For the life of me, I have been trying for months to rank 1st in the 3-pack for a specific keyword. Our website consistently ranks 1st on the google page, but our map-pack rankings have shifted to the 3rd and 4th spot for this specific keyword over the last year and our leads have really dried up. My goal is not to be int he 3-pack, but to be 1st. 

I have read all the posts on this subreddit for best practices. While we are getting caught up with most of the best practices that we see in this subreddit, almost all of them have been met according to my analysis and the tools we use. I am still working on better NAP consistency and citations, but many other factors are being met and our rankings do not change. 

Here is the kicker - my competition has no where near the presence that we do. All three organizations above me in the 3-pack cannot beat our marketing presence, but they still rank higher in the map pack. 

* We outrank them on google reviews (5-star reviews as well). 
* Our GMB page is fully built out. I mean fully. There is nothing left to add. 
* We make GMB posts regularly. 
* We respond to all reviews within 48 hours. 
* Our website has many more backlinks. 
* Our website typically has an ahrefs site audit score of 98-100%.
* Our website is nicer, more built out, and lists the keywords many more times that then competition. 
* Keywords are optimized for locality on the website. 
* Website page titles have been updated for keywords we are looking to rank for. 
* Blog posts exist. 
* Headings have all been adjusted/updated. 
* Images have alt text
* Google map with address is on website

  
Do not tell me it's about proximity. I have tested this, and we can be in our building, incognito mode, and search google for the keywords we want to rank and the competition still comes up before us. This is in chrome, safari, and firefox. 

Do not tell me it's about open hours. I have tested this even during closed hours where all of us in the map pack are closed. I still do not rank 1st, 2nd, and am often 3rd or 4th. Even when we are open and the competition is closed (we open 30 minutes before they do), they still show up above us in the 3-pack when they are CLOSED. 

I used to think that keyword stuffing the GMB business name would help. One of the competitors that is ALWAYS 1st, has this specific keyword IN THE NAME of their GMB listing. I addressed this with google by filling out the redressal form. Google has done nothing. In fact, I submitted this form 2-3 times highlighting that the legal busienss name does not include this keyword, google has done nothing and the keyword remains in the compeitotrs GMB business name. 

I spent 40k on ads last year to specifically advertise for this keyword. Those ads did not convert very well. When i turned them off and google called me about 30 times to get me to spend more money, I told them that it was not fair for me to pay for ads to rank for this keyword when they are openly allowing competitors to add the keyword to the GMB listing name and rank that way. Google dismissed my concerns and I have not spent any more money with them. Why would I when I can add the keyword to my business name and rank, just like the competition. 

I added the keyword to my business name, waited overnight to see if we would jump and rank, and we didn't so I moved it back to the regular business name. 

Its funny, because another competitor in another town does this same thing (keyword stuffing) and they are always in the 3-pack, usually 1st. This company has NO WEBSITE. So to those who say that the website helps you rank in the map-pack, that is FALSE. A company does not need a website to rank  in the map-pack, and I have a live example of it right now. 

So that leads to my next point. If competitor A has a website and keywords stuffs, and competitor B does not have a website and keyword stuffs, both rank in the map-pack, then it must be the GMB profile that has high weight on ranking. 

So I meticulously reviewed our GMB page with these compeititors, and we are even more built out than them. Like I mentioned above, more reviews, more services, more products, more posts, business description is optimized for the keywords we want to rank for. Even by doing this, we are still in the 3rd and 4th spot in the map-pack. Not first. I cannot get this needle to move. 

Tools I'm using:

1. Ahrefs

2. Brightlocal

  
I don't know what else to do. Aside from the NAP and citations work we still need to finalize, why are these competitors outranking us in the map pack with less presence? Everything I have read in this subreddit we do or try to do. My competition does not, and it is visible. How are they still ranking above us?    

  
It is important to note that 2/3 of the competitors that rank above us have more than one location. But still, if proximity mattered, why would multiple locations help? I cant start another location just to ""attempt"" to rank higher then them. This cant be the factor ranking them higher than us. If it was, the other 1/3 company would not be ranking as they have one location like I do.  

I'm looking for some advice. What to do next. What audit to perform next to see where/why we are deficient? If our presence is so much higher than the competition, and the factors listed in this post and in this subreddit are being met, why am I still in 3rd and 4th place? If anyone would be interested in looking into this with me, I would appreciate the help. I looked at hiring a fiverr gmb audit consultant but like always, not very many good options on that site that provide value. I'm hoping this post can gain some traction and get some SEO experts on the thread to help clear up some of these concerns. I have ready many posts in r/seo about the problems I mention in this post, maybe we can draft up some great high-level responses to these problems for others that like me, are having this problem. ",r/SEO,2025-08-06T15:58:57.000Z,post,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been doing marketing for the last 10 years. As an entrepreneur, I build all my own websites, seo, sem, optimization, audits, everything. I&amp;#39;ve hired consultatns in the past, never get anything worth the price so I keep doing it myself, while running the busienss.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the medical field and we are in a highly competitive niche.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the life of me, I have been trying for months to rank 1st in the 3-pack for a specific keyword. Our website consistently ranks 1st on the google page, but our map-pack rankings have shifted to the 3rd and 4th spot for this specific keyword over the last year and our leads have really dried up. My goal is not to be int he 3-pack, but to be 1st. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read all the posts on this subreddit for best practices. While we are getting caught up with most of the best practices that we see in this subreddit, almost all of them have been met according to my analysis and the tools we use. I am still working on better NAP consistency and citations, but many other factors are being met and our rankings do not change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the kicker - my competition has no where near the presence that we do. All three organizations above me in the 3-pack cannot beat our marketing presence, but they still rank higher in the map pack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We outrank them on google reviews (5-star reviews as well). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our GMB page is fully built out. I mean fully. There is nothing left to add. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We make GMB posts regularly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We respond to all reviews within 48 hours. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our website has many more backlinks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our website typically has an ahrefs site audit score of 98-100%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our website is nicer, more built out, and lists the keywords many more times that then competition. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keywords are optimized for locality on the website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website page titles have been updated for keywords we are looking to rank for. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog posts exist. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headings have all been adjusted/updated. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images have alt text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google map with address is on website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not tell me it&amp;#39;s about proximity. I have tested this, and we can be in our building, incognito mode, and search google for the keywords we want to rank and the competition still comes up before us. This is in chrome, safari, and firefox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not tell me it&amp;#39;s about open hours. I have tested this even during closed hours where all of us in the map pack are closed. I still do not rank 1st, 2nd, and am often 3rd or 4th. Even when we are open and the competition is closed (we open 30 minutes before they do), they still show up above us in the 3-pack when they are CLOSED. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think that keyword stuffing the GMB business name would help. One of the competitors that is ALWAYS 1st, has this specific keyword IN THE NAME of their GMB listing. I addressed this with google by filling out the redressal form. Google has done nothing. In fact, I submitted this form 2-3 times highlighting that the legal busienss name does not include this keyword, google has done nothing and the keyword remains in the compeitotrs GMB business name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent 40k on ads last year to specifically advertise for this keyword. Those ads did not convert very well. When i turned them off and google called me about 30 times to get me to spend more money, I told them that it was not fair for me to pay for ads to rank for this keyword when they are openly allowing competitors to add the keyword to the GMB listing name and rank that way. Google dismissed my concerns and I have not spent any more money with them. Why would I when I can add the keyword to my business name and rank, just like the competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added the keyword to my business name, waited overnight to see if we would jump and rank, and we didn&amp;#39;t so I moved it back to the regular business name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its funny, because another competitor in another town does this same thing (keyword stuffing) and they are always in the 3-pack, usually 1st. This company has NO WEBSITE. So to those who say that the website helps you rank in the map-pack, that is FALSE. A company does not need a website to rank  in the map-pack, and I have a live example of it right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that leads to my next point. If competitor A has a website and keywords stuffs, and competitor B does not have a website and keyword stuffs, both rank in the map-pack, then it must be the GMB profile that has high weight on ranking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I meticulously reviewed our GMB page with these compeititors, and we are even more built out than them. Like I mentioned above, more reviews, more services, more products, more posts, business description is optimized for the keywords we want to rank for. Even by doing this, we are still in the 3rd and 4th spot in the map-pack. Not first. I cannot get this needle to move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools I&amp;#39;m using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahrefs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brightlocal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what else to do. Aside from the NAP and citations work we still need to finalize, why are these competitors outranking us in the map pack with less presence? Everything I have read in this subreddit we do or try to do. My competition does not, and it is visible. How are they still ranking above us?    &lt;/p&gt;

"Hello, all! I'm helping out with a website rebuild for a local organization, and they've asked if we can soft-launch the new site one page at a time. That's not my usual MO, so I want to dot my I's and cross my T's before I wreck their rankings, if this is even an advisable way to do things.

As best I can figure, the plan would be to create a subdomain (new.organization.com or similar) for the new site, and then build one page at a time there, one-by-one swapping out links on the old site for new subdomain ones as I go, until, when all of the new pages are finally built, I flip the switch and route the primary domain to the new site for good.

Questions:

1. What is the risk to our page rankings, if any, when users are re-directed to a subdomain?
2. Should I be using 302 redirects on the primary domain side? 301? Or just in-line link swapping?
3. What question should I be asking that I am not?
4. Should I just say no? This all feels very silly to me, to be honest. I usually hold off on a re-launch until the new site is fully built, both to minimize opportunities for mistakes on the back-end but also to minimize confusion on the front end.

Sorry if this is a silly question I know it’s a bit unusual.

"Hey guys,

I'm kinda of OG of SEO (2004 - present) and dusting off the virtual webs on an idea I've had for awhile.

I’ve been thinking a lot about how much harder it’s become for smaller sites to build authority and visibility in today’s ultra-competitive search landscape. With algorithm shifts, AI content, and ever-growing corporate dominance, it feels like the old ways of “everyone wins” are fading out.

But what if we *flipped the script*?Imagine a cooperative network that a voluntary alliance of site owners and marketers, built on transparency, fair play, and shared benefit.

Here’s how it could work:

* **Members agree to feature high-quality, contextual links to each other’s content** (with clear guidelines for relevancy and editorial value).
* **Sites would be vetted for trust and quality** (so we avoid spammy networks and preserve the integrity).
* Automated or semi-automated systems help match partners and track links, but participation is always opt-in and transparent.
* No pay-for-play—only genuine, mutual value exchanges.

Benefits?

* Level the playing field for smaller sites against big brands
* Diversify link profiles and reduce over-reliance on paid outreach
* Build real relationships, not just transactions
* Create a feedback loop for content discovery and collaboration

I know networks have a bad rep when abused, but with smart governance, transparency, and quality standards, could a modern *SEO coop* be not only viable but *the next big thing* for community-driven growth?

Would love to hear if anyone’s tried similar approaches recently, and what pitfalls or opportunities you see if we built something like this.

Thanks in advance!

"Hello all

We launched a new site about 7 months ago and have been investing heavily (time and money) in SEO and content, with lead generation as the primary goal. I’m prepping for a 6-month performance audit with our SEO contractor and want to make sure I’m asking the right questions. not just about the numbers or what’s working well, but whether the current strategy is still the right fit.

For context: I’m primarily a PPC and HubSpot guy. I know enough about SEO to be dangerously curious, but not enough to fully audit the entire strategy on my own.

The contractor we’re working with is very experienced, but also extremely rigid—he’s had success with a particular formula in the past and is fully bought into it. To be blunt, I don’t think he believes he’s ever made a mistake. So the only way to get him to consider changing direction is to clearly show something isn’t working—and ideally, have him be the one to come to that conclusion.

this kind of rigidity would normally be a red flag for me. If I were choosing vendors, I’d probably be looking elsewhere. But due to a professional relationship he has with someone in leadership at the company, this partnership isn’t really mine to end—so I’m doing what I can to steer things in a better direction without causing friction.

That’s why I’m looking for open-ended, data-driven questions that can surface areas of underperformance and encourage deeper analysis—without triggering defensiveness.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar spot. What questions have helped you uncover gaps, reframe the strategy, or encourage more adaptive thinking—especially when lead gen is the core goal?

I have a blog that was starting to see some considerable growth after about a year. We're talking about 15-20% increase in clicks per week.

Then, I joined Journey by Mediavine in April, and around that time, I noticed my traffic started to plateau a bit. This was around the time that AI Mode started to gain traction, though, so it may have been because of that.

Recently, I did notice that it looks like for a few days, my site wasn't being crawled entirely, and there may have been some issues with CWV. However, that all seems to have since resolved itself.

"Hi y'all. My student job rolled into the maintenance and further development of a shopify webshop for a small firm. I've learned a lot since I began but since I started from nothing I'm still learning. Currently I'm working on improving our site's performance on google.

The firm had an old webshop which was outdated. This is replaced since a few months by a shopify webshop under the same domain name. When looking at indexed pages in google search console, i've noticed that we're facing a huge amount of unindexed pages with a similar form: /detail.php?id=... , /cat\_.php?sc=... , etc.. I came to the conclusion these are URL's from our old webshop. 

I'm now wondering what I should do with this large number of URL's which are not indexed. I don't have any access to the old webshop, so I have no idea what the initial destination/meaning of these url's were.  Did some research and came to the conclusion that there are 2 main possibilities:

* Leave these old url's as it's not a real problem for the performance as they are non-indexed
* Redirect all of them to the homepage

Currently I'm thinking of just leaving them since a redirect of an 'unknown' page, which I don't know the desired destination of, looks pointless to me. However, i'm not sure if all of these URL's are influencing my performance very badly.

"We bought a domain that looked clean (no indexation, no recent content). We built a new site on it using proper SEO practices — clean architecture, optimized content, fast loading — all things we've done successfully before.

"Hey /r/SEO 

I want to run a casus with you and hear your opinions.

I work at an agency and one of our clients is being attacked with p0rn-anchored backlinks. They get 70-80 daily backlinks from .xyz and other spammy domains, using anchor links similar to what a 3rd grader's search history would look like.

I know that Google usually ignores those. So far it hasn't visibly affected any rankings. The client is aware of that attack and is calm about it.

However, I am a bit worried about the volume of backlinks. It has been going for a month, with more than 1,200 backlinks from 450 different domains.

On one hand, I feel like their budget could be better used than creating a disavow file (not that it will take that much time).

"What if your website traffic plummets and sales stop? That's what has happened with one of my websites.

I was aware of the massive impact on information -centric website traffic. And, I have now experienced it first hand!

Google search takes information from webpages, rewrites and spits it out as it's own, labelling it as AI overview.

Why?

If there's no traffic, where's the incentive to provide the information?

One of my sites tumbled and sales came to zero. The problem? Google now shows the answers at the top, even giving obscure credit to my website. If that's not all, my website has been pushed down .

"Hey Guys!
Whenever you're planning to write a blog post around a specific keyword, how do you decide what kind of post to write that rank higher on Google? Also, just because you wrote a ""great content"" that alone won't rank higher in the search, right?

Like…

Do you check what’s already ranking and mimic it?

Do you use any tools to help you?

Or is it just based on what you feel makes sense? (based on your experience) 


I’ve been noticing that a lot of SEO advice talks about keyword difficulty and volume,  but not much about the actual stuff and intent that Google seems to favor (like how much of backlinks do I even need to rank higher on search higher, content cluster, domain authority etc)

That got me curious:
Would it be helpful if there was something that showed all the factors that google consider to position a site on high search results for a specific keyword ( like backlinks required, estimated time to take how long would it take for site to rank on that keyword, schema recommendations, Domain authority, technical requirement to meet like &lt;2.5 LCP, etc.) and so on, pretty much most of the thinf google consider to position rank these sites higher on google search.

Not trying to pitch anything, but I’m building a little project in this area and trying to see if the problem is even real, or if I’m overthinking it. I just want to hear from actual writers.

- Would something like that actually help you plan or write posts better?
- Or do you feel like you’ve already figured out your own process?

Appreciate any honest thoughts, even if it’s just “meh, this isn’t a problem.”

Thanks!

"**Google Search Console only shows you the tip of the iceberg.** In the last months, I audited 50+ websites using Screaming Frog, SEMrush, and Ahrefs. I found ranking-killing errors that GSC never mentioned.

Here are the 47 most common ones (and how to detect them):

## **DUPLICATE CONTENT ERRORS**

### 1. **Duplicate H1 within the same page**
**What it is:** Multiple H1 tags on a single page
**Why it hurts:** Confuses semantic hierarchy
**How to detect:** Screaming Frog &gt; H1 &gt; filter duplicates
**Real impact:** Saw 30% drops in organic CTR

### 2. **Duplicate titles in hidden elements**
**What it is:** Identical titles in CSS hidden modals/accordions
**Tool:** Screaming Frog &gt; Spider Config &gt; JavaScript rendering ON
**Fix:** Use aria-label instead of duplicate titles

### 3. **Identical meta descriptions from templates**
**Problem:** WordPress/Shopify auto-generates identical descriptions
**Detection:** SEMrush Site Audit &gt; Issues &gt; Duplicate meta descriptions
**Real case:** E-commerce had 847 pages with same meta description

## **LINK ISSUES (THAT GSC IGNORES)**

### 4. **Internal 404 broken links**
**GSC doesn't report:** Internal links returning 404
**Screaming Frog:** Response Codes &gt; 404 Client Error  
**Real case:** 156 broken links killed client's crawl budget

### 5. **429 Rate Limited broken links**
**What it is:** Server blocks Googlebot for too many requests
**Detection:** Screaming Frog &gt; Response Codes &gt; 429
**Why it matters:** Googlebot gives up, pages go unindexed

### 6. **Redirect chains 3+ hops**
**Problem:** A→B→C→D (Google stops at 3rd hop)
**Tool:** Ahrefs Site Audit &gt; Redirect chains
**Saw cases:** 7 redirects to reach final content

### 7. **JavaScript redirects GSC can't see**
**What they are:** window.location redirects
**Detection:** Screaming Frog with JavaScript rendering enabled
**Impact:** Link juice completely lost

## **TECHNICAL INDEXATION ISSUES**

### 8. **Incorrect self-referential canonical**
**Error:** rel=""canonical"" points to page with parameters
**Example:** canonical href=""/page?utm_source=google""
**Tool:** Screaming Frog &gt; Canonicals &gt; filter parameters

### 9. **Noindex on important pages**
**Where:** Templates accidentally adding noindex
**Real case:** Client's homepage had noindex from misconfigured plugin
**Detection:** Screaming Frog &gt; Directives &gt; Noindex

### 10. **Sitemap.xml includes 404 pages**
**Problem:** XML sitemap lists URLs that return errors
**Impact:** Wastes crawl budget
**Check:** Screaming Frog &gt; Sitemaps &gt; Response codes

### 11. **Pagination missing rel=""next/prev""**
**Error:** Google doesn't understand page sequence
**Detection:** Manual View Source check on paginated pages
**Fix:** Implement rel=""next"" and rel=""prev""

## **SPEED ISSUES GSC DOESN'T SEE**

### 12. **Low text-to-HTML ratio**
**What it is:** More code than useful content
**Bad ratio:** &lt;15% text vs total HTML
**Tool:** Screaming Frog &gt; Page Titles &gt; Text ratio
**Case:** Site with 8% ratio - terrible rankings

### 13. **JavaScript blocks First Contentful Paint**
**Problem:** Render-blocking JS in &lt;head&gt;
**GSC:** Only shows Core Web Vitals, not specific cause
**Tool:** PageSpeed Insights &gt; Opportunities &gt; Eliminate render-blocking resources

### 14. **Images without width/height dimensions**
**Error:** Layout shifts from unsized images
**Impact:** High CLS, rankings drop
**Check:** Screaming Frog &gt; Images &gt; Missing width/height

### 15. **Fonts loading without font-display: swap**
**Problem:** FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)
**Tool:** Chrome DevTools &gt; Network &gt; Fonts
**Fix:** Add font-display: swap to all @font-face rules

## **SCHEMA MARKUP ERRORS**

### 16. **Malformed JSON-LD**
**Error:** Incorrect JSON syntax
**GSC:** Rich Results Test says ""valid"" but it's broken
**Real tool:** Schema.org validator + Screaming Frog Schema extraction

### 17. **Duplicate Schema (JSON-LD + Microdata)**
**Problem:** Same data in 2 formats
**Confuses:** Google doesn't know which to use
**Detection:** Screaming Frog &gt; Structured Data &gt; Multiple formats

### 18. **Incorrect date format in Schema**
**Error:** ""2024-1-15"" instead of ""2024-01-15""
**Impact:** Rich snippets don't appear
**Check:** Rich Results Test individual pages

## **MOBILE ISSUES (BEYOND GSC)**

### 19. **Incorrect viewport meta tag**
**Common error:** `&lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width""&gt;`
**Missing:** initial-scale=1
**Tool:** Google Mobile-Friendly Test

### 20. **Buttons/links too small for mobile**
**Problem:** &lt;44px target size
**GSC doesn't say:** Which ones specifically are problematic
**Tool:** Chrome DevTools &gt; Mobile simulation + accessibility audit

### 21. **Important content hidden on mobile**
**Error:** display:none on mobile for SEO-important content
**Check:** Screaming Frog &gt; User-Agent switching

## **CRAWL BUDGET ISSUES**

### 22. **URLs with infinite parameters**
**Example:** /page?color=red&amp;size=M&amp;sort=price&amp;view=grid...
**Problem:** Wastes crawl budget
**Tool:** Screaming Frog &gt; URL Parameters
**Solution:** Parameter handling in GSC + canonicals

### 23. **Faceted navigation without noindex**
**Error:** /category?price=100-200&amp;brand=nike&amp;color=blue indexable
**Result:** Millions of filter URLs
**Fix:** Noindex filters, canonical to base page

### 24. **Indexable search results pages**
**Problem:** /search?q=red+shoes indexable
**Wastes:** Crawl budget massively
**Check:** site:domain.com ""search results"" in Google

## **INTERNATIONALIZATION ERRORS**

### 25. **Hreflang incorrectly implemented**
**Error:** hreflang=""es-ES"" but content in English
**GSC:** Only says ""hreflang errors"", doesn't specify which
**Tool:** Screaming Frog &gt; Hreflang tab

### 26. **Geographic URLs without hreflang**
**Example:** /es/product and /mx/product without hreflang
**Problem:** Google doesn't know which to show Spain vs Mexico users
**Check:** Screaming Frog &gt; Hreflang &gt; Missing hreflang

## **AI-GENERATED CONTENT ISSUES**

### 27. **Detectable AI-generated content**
**What happens:** Repetitive patterns, limited vocabulary
**Tools:** Copyleaks AI detector + manual review
**Saw cases:** Rankings dropped 60% post-helpful content update

### 28. **Masked thin content**
**Trick:** White text on white background
**Detection:** Screaming Frog &gt; Extract text &gt; analyze length vs visible
**Penalty:** Manual action guaranteed

## **ADVANCED TECHNICAL ERRORS**

### 29. **Misconfigured HTTP/2 Server Push**
**Problem:** Push resources browser already has cached
**Impact:** Slower loading, not faster
**Tool:** Chrome DevTools &gt; Network &gt; Protocol column

### 30. **Incorrect preload hints**
**Error:** `&lt;link rel=""preload""&gt;` for non-critical resources
**Result:** Wastes initial bandwidth
**Check:** Chrome DevTools &gt; Network &gt; Priority column

### 31. **Service Worker caches 404 pages**
**Bug:** SW serves cached 404s
**Problem:** Google sees permanently cached 404
**Detection:** Chrome DevTools &gt; Application &gt; Service Workers

### 32. **Lazy loading images above the fold**
**Error:** loading=""lazy"" on hero images
**Impact:** Terrible LCP
**Tool:** PageSpeed Insights &gt; Diagnostics

### 33. **Incomplete critical CSS**
**Problem:** Critical CSS doesn't include mobile styles
**Result:** Massive layout shifts on mobile
**Check:** Chrome DevTools &gt; Mobile + Coverage tab

## **SERVER/HOSTING ISSUES**

### 34. **DNS TTL too high**
**Problem:** 86400s (24h) TTL for development site
**Impact:** Server changes take 24h to propagate
**Check:** dig domain.com + TTL value

### 35. **Gzip not enabled for HTML**
**Error:** Compress images but not HTML/CSS/JS
**Tool:** GTmetrix &gt; Enable gzip compression
**Case:** 40% reduction in HTML size

### 36. **HTTP/2 not enabled**
**2025 and still see:** Sites on HTTP/1.1
**Impact:** Lost multiplexing, slower loading
**Check:** Chrome DevTools &gt; Network &gt; Protocol

### 37. **Missing server response headers**
**Missing:** X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
**Security:** Clickjacking, MIME sniffing attacks
**SEO impact:** Google prefers secure sites
**Tool:** Security Headers checker

## **ANALYTICS/TRACKING ISSUES**

### 38. **GTM firing multiple GA4 events**
**Bug:** Same event fires 3x per pageview
**Impact:** Inflated metrics, wrong decisions
**Debug:** GA4 DebugView + GTM Preview

### 39. **Tracking code blocking render**
**Error:** GA/GTM in &lt;head&gt; without async
**Result:** Slower FCP
**Fix:** async/defer + move to end of &lt;body&gt;

### 40. **Search Console data delayed**
**Not error but:** Data 2-3 days behind
**Cause:** Incorrect GSC implementation
**Check:** Property type (Domain vs URL prefix)

## **MULTIMEDIA CONTENT ERRORS**

### 41. **Videos without transcripts**
**Miss:** Video content not accessible to Google
**SEO loss:** Keywords in audio not indexed
**Tool:** Manual transcription + schema VideoObject

### 42. **Images missing alt text (not just empty)**
**Difference:** alt="""" vs no alt attribute
**Screen readers:** Different behaviors
**Check:** Screaming Frog &gt; Images &gt; Missing alt text

### 43. **PDF files in sitemap**
**Problem:** PDFs in XML sitemap
**Better:** Landing page embedding PDF + text summary
**Why:** Better UX + indexable content

## **E-COMMERCE SPECIFIC ISSUES**

### 44. **Product variants creating infinite URLs**
**Example:** /product?size=S&amp;color=red&amp;material=cotton...
**Solution:** Canonical to main product + structured data variants
**Tool:** Screaming Frog &gt; Parameters analysis

### 45. **Out of stock pages return 404**
**Error:** Sold out product = 404
**Better:** 200 + ""out of stock"" + schema availability
**Why:** Keep link equity + better UX

## **WORDPRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES**

### 46. **Plugin conflicts affecting crawling**
**Common:** Security plugin blocking Googlebot User-Agent
**Detection:** Screaming Frog &gt; Custom User-Agent = Googlebot
**Fix:** Whitelist Googlebot in security settings

### 47. **WordPress REST API leaking sensitive data**
**URL:** /wp-json/wp/v2/users
**Exposes:** Author info, potentially sensitive data
**Fix:** Restrict REST API access
**SEO:** Duplicate content + security issues

## **My tool stack for detecting all this:**

**Crawling:** Screaming Frog
**Technical:** Ahrefs Site Audit (finds 80% of these issues)
**Speed:** GTmetrix + PageSpeed Insights
**Schema:** Schema.org validator + Rich Results Test
**Manual:** Chrome DevTools + extensions (like One click Seo)

## **Process I follow:**

1. **Complete Screaming Frog crawl** (JS rendering ON)
2. **Ahrefs site audit** in parallel
3. **Manual spot checks** on important pages
4. **GTmetrix analysis** on key pages
5. **Schema validation** on main templates

**Total time:** 4-6 hours for 1000+ page site
**Typical ROI:** 25-40% organic traffic improvement in 90 days

Most of these errors are **invisible in Google Search Console** but **silently kill your rankings**.

What tools do you use for technical audits? Have you found other errors GSC ignores?

*I work primarily with e-commerce sites, but these errors appear across all industries. Happy to dive deeper into any specific ones.*",r/SEO,2025-08-04T18:44:21.000Z,post,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Search Console only shows you the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/strong&gt; In the last months, I audited 50+ websites using Screaming Frog, SEMrush, and Ahrefs. I found ranking-killing errors that GSC never mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the 47 most common ones (and how to detect them):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUPLICATE CONTENT ERRORS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Duplicate H1 within the same page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is:&lt;/strong&gt; Multiple H1 tags on a single page
&lt;strong&gt;Why it hurts:&lt;/strong&gt; Confuses semantic hierarchy
&lt;strong&gt;How to detect:&lt;/strong&gt; Screaming Frog &amp;gt; H1 &amp;gt; filter duplicates
&lt;strong&gt;Real impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Saw 30% drops in organic CTR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Duplicate titles in hidden elements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is:&lt;/strong&gt; Identical titles in CSS hidden modals/accordions
&lt;strong&gt;Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Screaming Frog &amp;gt; Spider Config &amp;gt; JavaScript rendering ON
&lt;strong&gt;Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Use aria-label instead of duplicate titles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Identical meta descriptions from templates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; WordPress/Shopify auto-generates identical descriptions
&lt;strong&gt;Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; SEMrush Site Audit &amp;gt; Issues &amp;gt; Duplicate meta descriptions
&lt;strong&gt;Real case:&lt;/strong&gt; E-commerce had 847 pages with same meta description&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINK ISSUES (THAT GSC IGNORES)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Internal 404 broken links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GSC doesn&amp;#39;t report:&lt;/strong&gt; Internal links returning 404
&lt;strong&gt;Screaming Frog:&lt;/strong&gt; Response Codes &amp;gt; 404 Client Error&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Real case:&lt;/strong&gt; 156 broken links killed client&amp;#39;s crawl budget&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;429 Rate Limited broken links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is:&lt;/strong&gt; Server blocks Googlebot for too many requests
&lt;strong&gt;Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Screaming Frog &amp;gt; Response Codes &amp;gt; 429
&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Googlebot gives up, pages go unindexed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Redirect chains 3+ hops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; A→B→C→D (Google stops at 3rd hop)
&lt;strong&gt;Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Ahrefs Site Audit &amp;gt; Redirect chains
&lt;strong&gt;Saw cases:&lt;/strong&gt; 7 redirects to reach final content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript redirects GSC can&amp;#39;t see&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they are:&lt;/strong&gt; window.location redirects
&lt;strong&gt;Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Screaming Frog with JavaScript rendering enabled
&lt;strong&gt;Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Link juice completely lost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TECHNICAL INDEXATION ISSUES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;Incorrect self-referential canonical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error:&lt;/strong&gt; rel=&amp;quot;canonical&amp;quot; points to page with parameters
&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; canonical href=&amp;quot;/page?utm_source=google&amp;quot;
&lt;strong&gt;Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Screaming Frog &amp;gt; Canonicals &amp;gt; filter parameters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;9. &lt;strong&gt;Noindex on important pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; Templates accidentally adding noindex
&lt;strong&gt;Real case:&lt;/strong&gt; Client&amp;#39;s homepage had noindex from misconfigured plugin
&lt;strong&gt;Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Screaming Frog &amp;gt; Directives &amp;gt; Noindex&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;Sitemap.xml includes 404 pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; XML sitemap lists URLs that return errors
&lt;strong&gt;Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Wastes crawl budget
&lt;strong&gt;Check:&lt;/strong&gt; Screaming Frog &amp;gt; Sitemaps &amp;gt; Response codes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;11. &lt;strong&gt;Pagination missing rel=&amp;quot;next/prev&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error:&lt;/strong&gt; Google doesn&amp;#39;t understand page sequence
&lt;strong&gt;Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Manual View Source check on paginated pages
&lt;strong&gt;Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Implement rel=&amp;quot;next&amp;quot; and rel=&amp;quot;prev&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPEED ISSUES GSC DOESN&amp;#39;T SEE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;12. &lt;strong&gt;Low text-to-HTML ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is:&lt;/strong&gt; More code than useful content
&lt;strong&gt;Bad ratio:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;lt;15% text vs total HTML
**Tool:** Screaming Frog &amp;gt; Page Titles &amp;gt; Text ratio
&lt;strong&gt;Case:&lt;/strong&gt; Site with 8% ratio - terrible rankings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;13. &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript blocks First Contentful Paint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; Render-blocking JS in &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;

"Hi everyone,

I noticed something strange with my site in Google. When I use the site: operator, the index page doesn't show up in the results. All other internal pages are listed, but the main page is completely missing.

"Hey everyone, some of you may know me, as I have been commenting here pretty much daily for months.

My post here is about the general feeling of incompetence I've had about myself for the last few months and your thoughts on whether it's legit or just low self-esteem. I don't really know how to put it into words, in short, so here's my story.

**Background:** I started out making rank and rent sites and have also done some very small paid ad gigs for my parents's friends companies (clicks in Serbia were remarkably cheap at the time; I was in high school and college).

Put those on a resume and got an SEO Specialist position at a local SEO agency in the US (working remotely from Serbia); have been there for 1 year and 3 months. Got laid off after a health issue kept me unproductive for months.

Unsure what to do, I wandered through forums and connected with a US-based local business owner. He asked me if I could help him; he was my first freelance SEO client. I *doubled* his traffic in a month or so, which was *pure luck* (he had existing authority for those service and info keywords; I didn't fully grasp how authority worked at the time, nor did I have adequate authority-building knowledge).

Unaware it was just pure luck and that causation =/= correlation, I was like, ""this is it; let's keep going the freelance route."" The next client, also from a forum shortly after, saw some quick ranking improvements and a few leads, which they said ""found them on Google.""

Kept working with the second client, along with a few white label projects along the way, **none** of which worked.

Fast forward to today (a year and 2 months), the second client is still with me, claiming she's very happy, as her phone is ringing. She did rank for *some service keywords* in the Map pack*,* but not the root yet (main service KW with the most volume and high CPC). The website is also on the first page for some services, but not the root. Also running paid and LSAs now too, but the customers just say, again, ""found you on Google."" Hard to attribute.

But looking back, I made mistakes:

* Inadequate reporting; I only went off of their recollection of previous results they got from other providers (low to none, no links built as well)
* No link-building knowledge, which I obsessively sought over time, and I built 15-20 links through HARO and referral partnerships, but I tripped up so many times and sent bad emails out of pressure on client's behalf
* Replicating the process from my previous agency (150+ clients, 20-30 staff), which was just content + buy links. Luckily, I've only done this for, say, a month after I realized it wasn't a good direction. I have also been lucky in the ability to actually remove links I bought for the clients to remove the risk.

Not sure where to go from here. I *did* recently ask the client that's been the longest with me if she's unhappy, l'm willing to work for free until she is, but she said there's no need to and that I surely have been better than her previous hires, which made me slightly at peace. She also referred me to some of her friends recently.

But the feeling still remains. I'm led to believe I need 3-5 solid years under someone's wing, but my experiences with superiors at agencies so far (2 full-time, one of which only lasted 2 weeks; others white-label) have mostly been horrible. It felt like *I* needed to be educating *them.*

Currently each client/white label project has paid $300-$500/mo up to date, and I have kept that as my rate so far.

That's it. Of course, I tried to keep this as short as possible, but still it got too long. Sorry about that; I hope I can get some good thoughts anyway from more experienced people.

Up until June 2025, all my pages were indexed properly. But now in Google Search Console, it shows 0 pages indexed. The status of all previously indexed pages has changed to “Crawled - Currently Not Indexed.”

Here’s what I’ve checked so far:

* Sitemap is accessible and validated in Search Console.
* robots.txt is not blocking any pages.
* Page speed is within normal limits.
* I’ve already improved the content on the pages and enhanced internal linking. After that I submitted a ""Validate Fix"" request in Google Search Console, but I’m still facing the same issue.
* When I try `site:mydomain` no pages show up — likely because none are currently indexed.

Nothing obvious seems wrong on the surface. Has anyone experienced a similar issue? Any ideas what I should check next or what could be causing this?

"Hi all,

I have a process for writing and optimising target keywords in my niche.

1. This is what I usually do when trying to optimise the ranking:

* When checking through my existing Top 10 rankings, for example, I would pick one keyword that I'm already ranking for, let's say on 6th position. I usualy get this data from ahrefs.
* In order to further optimise that page, I will edit that post.
* Let's say for example, right now I have found a keyword that I am on postition 11, keyword ""mandelic acid deodorant"". I want to edit this post to take my ranking higher.
* Now, what I usually do is search on google for this specific keyword ""mandelic acid deodorant"" and I would check several things like other top ranking posts, but also the 'People also search for' section at the bottom of the page.
* I would find another keyword 'people also search for' and then I edit my post to include that keyword.

Question:

* Let's say I find another 'People also search for' keyword, which is ""mandelic acid body wash"", should I 'edit my post' and try to include this keyword within the article, which should help take that page ranking higher?
* Or - is it a better idea to create a new post, targeting that keyword ""mandelic acid body wash"", separately?
* Or - should I do both?

"Hey guys,

SEO used to be a fun learning experience, I used to take courses, learn from the experts, build websites here and there and test things out. It not only helped me make extra money, but learning it was a fun hobby.

Since the ""AI"" revolution however, I've lost my motivation.  
Google pushes more and more AI content, and we all know it's only going to get worse. Most people don't even click pages anymore, they simply read the ""AI Summary"".

A lot of the first pages are now also filled with AI sloppy, and paying a writer doesn't seem to be worth it either.

Overall, I've abandoned most of my ""SEO Website Ideas"" not because they failed, but because I've lost trust in the system and never even tried to build them.

So, where do I go from there? Like, this used to be a nice hobby and now I feel kinda lost of what to study, what to do, where to go and such. This is not a ""financial crisis"" it's more of a ""boredom crisis"" or ""motivation crisis"" so to say. Is there any future for SEO? What is this future now and where can I learn more about it?

"This is just my hypothesis, I'll be glad to read yours.

**1/ Non-obvious reason**

Many businesses got organic traffic before without hiring any SEO expert. They did some basic work well without all the SEO knowledge: published pages with products or services, case studies, wrote guides on how to use their products, etc.

It was enough to be indexed and get some traffic from Google in a lot of non-competitive niches.

Now, as Google eats more and more of everyone's traffic, even such businesses look for an SEO agency.

**2/ Reevaluation of the old partners and approaches**

When businesses see the rising traffic from AI chats in their GA4 properties, and everyone talks about AI hype, it's clear to them that huge changes are happening now.

The biggest question they ask: Does my agency, or consultant, or an in-house expert do enough to adapt to this new reality?

This question creates a huge demand to look for other agencies to compare their approaches with the current partner.

"Hi everyone,

I’m learning more about international SEO and wanted to understand how SEO is typically handled when a website is targeting multiple countries or regions.

Some key things I’m curious about:

- What's the best way to structure the site: subfolders, subdomains, or separate ccTLDs?
- How is hreflang handled in such setups?
- Is it better to have one global site or separate versions per country?
- How do SEOs avoid duplicate content issues across different regions/languages?
- Can the same page be optimized for multiple countries? If yes, how?
- How do you track keyword rankings per country or region?
  - I've tried Ubersuggest — but wondering how reliable it is.
  - Is a VPN needed for accurate rank checking?
- Any tools, processes, or common mistakes to be aware of?

"As a Therapist, money for SEO has been tight so  6 months ago I decided to learn SEO myself. I used Hostinger drag-and-drop site which may have been a mistake. I also used ChatGPT agents for research and learning. I structured clean URLs, hand-polished meta-descriptions, and added LocalBusiness  and FAQPage schema everywhere I could. I built topical service pages and then blog clusters around therapy for lawyers, physicians, entrepreneurs, executives, creatives, EMDR, and coaching-vs-therapy; each long-form blog post (20 so far) were drafted in my voice, then keyword-scored and tweaked by ChatGPT for flow. 

The site went live three months ago, and last week  my new office went live on Google Maps. I've attempted to optimize my Google profile there.

I just started tracking ~54 local &amp; niche terms in Local Falcon since office opened on 7/23.

GSC last 3 months: 6.2k impressions | 11 clicks | 0.2 % CTR | avg pos 74), 

Using PostHog, Hotjar, GA4 to try and understand user behavior and optimize pages. I seem to have good site engagement just low traffic.

Bing Webmaster setup with better results than GSC. Bing results 116 impressions with 12 clicks.

My niche is high-achieving professionals: executives, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs...this population still searches generic terms like “therapist near me,” so my keyword plan feels split between hyper-niche (“therapy for executives”) and plain-vanilla local intent.

Backlinks are the elephant in the room. So far I’ve only got random no-follow links that showed up when I bought the domain. I’m currently pitching state bar associations, lawyer-wellness podcasts, daily HARO requests, and trying for niche publications with stuff in the category of Forbes or Entrepreneur Mag- through the lens of of therapy and business.

Where I’m stuck / what I’d love your take on

1. Does it truly just take a while for keywords to rank? Alot of my niche keywords have low KD but they aren't coming below 40 -80 since launching 3 months ago.

2. GSC keeps dropping my FAQ rich-result. My understanding is this is a Hostinger JS render issue and not ideal but can be fixed if I overcome low authority?

3. Smart, white-hat backlink angles for a therapy brand serving professionals.

"Hi everyone,

I'm trying to filter out all question-based search queries in Google Search Console using the Custom (regex) filter with ""doesn’t match regex"". Specifically, I want to exclude:

Queries that contain common question words like what, how, why, who, can, etc.

Queries that contain a question mark (?)

I tried using this regex:

\^(?!.\*\\b(what|how|why|who|can|is|are)\\b|\\?).\*$

But it doesn't seem to work correctly in GSC's ""doesn’t match regex"" filter.

My Questions:

Does anyone have a working regex pattern for this kind of exclusion?

Is there a better or alternative method (maybe without listing all question words like what, why, how) to filter out these queries more efficiently?

"I’ve been running in-house SEO for the last couple of years, fully focused on content, technical fixes, UX, internal linking, indexing, all the unsexy basics. No outreach, no link building. That side of things just wasn’t on the table for reasons I won’t get into here.

Now I’ve picked up a freelance client. Great digital product, genuinely useful, decent market fit, but the site is completely new. Fresh domain. No authority. No backlinks. No mentions. It’s basically invisible to anyone not already searching brand terms. Being a new business, there are also no customers that I can use for testimonials - but that's another story, too. 

I’ve already built out a content strategy that’s starting to show traction. It’s being indexed. We’re seeing early signs in Search Console that things are headed the right way. But without backlinks, this domain’s going to top out far too early. I can feel the ceiling already.

I’m working from the idea that well-executed, boring SEO still works. Doesn’t matter how good AI/GEO get, authority, relevance, clarity, crawlability… they still matter. And that’s what I’m building on.

But, I’ve been out of the backlink game for a while. My last outreach campaign was two years ago. Back then it was guest posts, link insertions, exchanges, and a lot of cold emails. That worked. But I have no idea how much of that still flies in 2025.

So I’m asking:  
If you’re building backlinks and brand authority right now, where are you starting?

This includes optimized titles for pages and subheadings, keywords included in meta descriptions, and keyword friendly meta descriptions and keyword in all alt text. I basically chose one keyword and just used it over and over, not sure if I was supposed to do that, but that made sense to me. I am working on a WordPress system, WooCommerce to be exacty and had a question about any other things I need to do. I also submitted a map of my site to Google Search Console. So here&amp;#39;s the stuff that goes over my head, schema markup, cannoical tags for duplicate content, and a robot.text file. So these are the things that are beyond me technically and skill-wise, my question is this: Do I need to even pay attention to this, if I got my keywords and I have a contact page that is updated and has good loading speed? &lt;/p&gt;

I have the issue that my website is available in the same language, but different regions, e.g.

"# Link building is also for AI SEO and LLM SEO

As people are observing - LLMs are not distinct search engines with their own criteria - they are using Query Fan Out in search engines means that LLM visibility is down to backlinks.

So apart from buying backlinks and because Social Media doesn't help directly and BYO don't have any carriage - what can people do?

# Idea 1: Collect Data for PR

PR Driven - collect data, run surveys and learn how to summarize data for interesting use for your PR teams. I'm sure your PR partners can give input on what their news partners find interesting.

Q: Have you thought of doing this? Any PR experts have some stories to tell or questions to share?

PR is more that Press Release Wires - its about getting featured in articles too

# Idea 2: Joint Go-To Market

Joint Go-To-Market - create blog articles about joint offerings - use that to expand topical authority. The key here is to avoid linking on your branded terms - give Google useful context. Dont link to 'Our partners, Brian's Plumbing"": - link to ""our Rhode Island Domestic Plumbing services partner"". But you have to help both pages get traffic. The best thing about outbound linking: you can transform numerical authority into ANY topical authority - the remote topic does not have to be relevant to your whole site - this a is a common but completely unbased myth.

Q: Who else has done this, what have been your experiences and what can be done to level up? What other scenarios can you build out:?\]

Q; This can work outside of local? What about technology integrations in SaaS products?

# Idea 3: Trading SEO Services

As a digital marketing vendor/SEO expert or provider - can you lend your digital skills to your clients partners?

I did this at Kemp - and I did it in two ways

1. We help our resale partners SEO - their sales = our sales. So how deo we help craft content, rank it, link to it.

The great thing is you can use your limited available le of backlinks to help another domain, and then ask for backlinks in return for your time - thus getting new sources of authority back to you client

Q: Can you do this via affiliates? In B2C or B2B?

2. Our Inbound team also managed our influencers - and something I still do as a boutique, specialist SEO agency. We help SaaS influencers grow their traffic on behalf of our clients

"I've been in business/had a website for about 13 years, and in that time, have done no intentional SEO. When I made my first website), my first bit of advertising was to sponsor a forum that covered the niche that my products catered to. A few hundred bucks a year got me a rotating banner at the top and bottom of each page, a banner in the signature of my posts (I was a member for years prior), and self promotion privileges. I was strictly thinking this would be advertising to the members of that forum, but it seems that I gained decent SEO from that, because my google ranking was always pretty strong.

That seemed to have lasted about a decade, but the last few years, I noticed fewer and fewer new customers. Didn't look into it because I was busy with wholesale work, but now I'm digging into it. That forum has been in decline for a handful of years, so I thought that may be partly to blame.

I'm going to reach out to them to see if I can get the nofollow status removed on the basis of dwindling membership/sponsorship, and also on the basis that other forums in that niche don't seem to have nofollow status on their paid sponsors (and/or, start sponsoring that other forum).

"This may be a *duh* question, but I've honestly got several different answers from experts, so I don't know what to think. My question is about sitemap structure for local SEO and the benefits.

Let's take, for example, a law firm that does personal injury in Seattle. To make it easy, let's say they do Car Accidents, Motorcycle Accidents, and Truck Accidents. They have offices in Seattle, Tacoma, and Bellevue. They have pages w/ content for a combination of each practice area and location:

1. Car Accidents Seattle
2. Car Accidents Tacoma
3. Car Accidents Bellevue
4. Motorcycle Accidents Seattle
5. Motorcycle Accidents Tacoma
6. Motorcycle Accidents Bellevue
7. Truck Accidents Seattle
8. Truck Accidents Tacoma
9. Truck Accidents Bellevue

How much does having a solid site map structure really help them rank in Google?

Here are a few options of what they might have:  
  
**Option 1 - Flat URL Structure**  
domain(dot)com/practiceareas/seattle-car-accidents  
domain(dot)com/practiceareas/seattle-truck-accidents  
domain(dot)com/practiceareas/tacoma-car-accidents  
etc.

**Option 2 - Structure designed for primary office (Seattle) and flat structure for other areas.**  
domain(dot)com/practiceareas/car-accidents (Seattle Based)  
domain(dot)com/practiceareas/truck-accidents (Seattle Based)  
domain(dot)com/practiceareas/tacoma-car-accidents (Tacoma Based)

And regardless of the structure, does the actual Navigation bar layout make a difference? Like having  a navigation with ""Practice Areas"" with sub navigation items with ""Car Accidents"", ""Truck Accidents"", and ""Motorcycle Accidents"" that all lead to the Seattle Page. And then having another navigation item with ""Locations"" that lists all 3 locations with those linking to the other cities' practice pages.

Or even having just Seattle pages listed and not even listing the other cities or their pages in the nav (or anywhere else on the site) and just indexing them and using them for search only? (I realize this is bad UX, but does it affects SEO?)

TL;DR - Does having a really clean URL structure with a navigation that closely matches affect page ranking? And how much does it really help? (A lot?  A little?)",r/SEO,2025-07-29T00:24:49.000Z,post,Help,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be a &lt;em&gt;duh&lt;/em&gt; question, but I&amp;#39;ve honestly got several different answers from experts, so I don&amp;#39;t know what to think.

"Hey all - I'm a web developer by day, but I'm running up against our new Director of Marketing (I'll call them Alex) on an issue I am almost certain is a very poor SEO decision.

Long story short, Alex has compiled a lot of very common search terms related to what our organization does (we're in a field related to volunteer coordination) - but they are insisting that we stick these search terms into our page titles WITHOUT including anything related to the H1 titles on many of our pages. 

I'll provide a (heavily-obscured) example: we have a page that displays different events hosted by our organization. Some of these events are more volunteer orientation/""how-to"" focused, and some are not. Alex is insisting that, while the canonical H1 title says ""Events,"" the page title should be set to ""How to Become a Volunteer in \[Location\] | \[Site Title\]"". Similarly, we have a lot of pages with titles that technically include the H1, but they're littered with search terms, like ""\[Volunteer Opportunity\] in \[Location\] | What is \[Volunteer Opportunity\] | \[Site Title\]"". The ""Our Staff"" page's title is ""\[Volunteer Opportunity\] in \[Location\] | Our Staff | \[Site Title\]"", putting the actual H1 title (""Our Staff"") halfway through the incredibly long title. There is no pattern to any of our page titles, either - not even the site title is consistently at the end of each one.

I am more than willing to be wrong here - but I have never seen another website litter their titles with search terms to this extent, nor have I *ever* encountered a page whose title didn't actually reflect the content of the page. I've tried bringing this up with Alex, but was essentially met with ""I'm trained in SEO, and I know these are the terms people are searching, so we have to put them in the titles!""

Does anyone here have any resources I can point to (beyond just my anecdotal ""I have literally never seen this"") if I escalate this, or is this actually a practice some sites use that I've just never encountered?

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Try not to combine multiple moves to a single location. Moving sites A, B, and C all to new location D can cause some confusion and traffic loss. You might want to move sites one at a time to the new, combined location and wait till traffic stabilizes before moving the next site.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Any suggestions about how to decide which order to set up the 301s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Should I redirect the site with the most traffic first? Or the site with the most revenue? (We&amp;#39;re trying to mitigate lost revenue.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Should I stagger them by 4-6 weeks each? I know it says &amp;quot;wait until traffic stabilizes before moving the next site, but that&amp;#39;s impossible to predict. We have until Feb 2026 to move all 4.&lt;/p&gt;

"First of all: This post is only intended to share what has happened to me and wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar.

I'm not expecting any support or a solution to my problem here. Luckily, it doesn’t hurt me from a business perspective - but it’s still incredibly frustrating.

So, a few months ago, I started diving back into SEO and decided to apply what I was learning to a website that had been dormant for a while. I wasn’t always consistent with my work on it, but early signs were promising: Google impressions and clicks were growing steadily, and it seemed like I was on the right track.

**Then, out of nowhere, everything crashed.**

First, I received an email saying my AdSense account was suspended due to policy violations - but the message didn’t explain what exactly I had done wrong. I submitted an appeal and got a response saying the suspension had been lifted… but in reality, my account was still terminated, and I haven’t heard back from support since.

I suspect the issue may be related to a large spike in traffic in June, which came from a naturally trending keyword - nothing artificial, no manipulation. But let’s put the AdSense drama aside for now.

The bigger problem: **SEO traffic vanished overnight**

I kept working on the site and tried to ignore the AdSense issue. But a few days later, my organic search traffic tanked. Pages that had ranked in the top 3 suddenly dropped to page 2 or lower and with that, traffic dropped to almost zero - from 15.000 impressions and 250 clicks per day (trending upwards) to 2.300 impressions and 20 clicks.

I didn’t change anything major on the site. On the contrary: I added new, relevant content.

I’ve read on this subreddit and elsewhere that some recent Google updates have hit websites hard, and maybe that’s what happened here. Or maybe Google doesn't want to promote my site anymore because I am not using their ads? No idea... but getting banned from AdSense for no clear reason and losing nearly all search traffic within days is brutal.

I can’t help but think about all the people who actually rely on this for their income. Being cut off by Google without warning or recourse must be devastating.",r/SEO,2025-07-28T12:53:31.000Z,post,Rant,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all: This post is only intended to share what has happened to me and wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

"I need help. I signed up for a service through Search Atlas Group that uses Stripe for billing. The service had issues during sign-up and asked me to redo the trial process twice. I never got a confirmation email or anything useful — just instant access.

A few days later, I am being charged $100 per day, even though:
	•	I canceled and got an email confirming cancellation
	•	My account shows no active subscription
	•	I emailed them twice (including a warning I’d sue) with no response
	•	I even blocked the company via my bank, but it’s still going through somehow

We’ve spent more time trying to stop them than actually using the product. This feels like a scam or at least extremely shady business. Stripe is processing the charges, but I can’t get them to stop on my end.

	•	Emailed the company twice (ignored)

* Average CTR: 0.1%
* Average position: 79.2

"Hi all,

I’ve recently faced a frustrating SEO issue and would appreciate any guidance.

Meanwhile, other websites with similar content and ranking for the same keywords remain unaffected — even those that display media company logos. I’m unsure why only my site was targeted.

"Do you guys think Google is using user engagement, device context, and content appeal (not just relevance/authority) as direct or indirect ranking signals?

|Patent Title|What It Does|What It Means|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Contextual Ranking of Photos and Text** (US 10,671,660 B2)|Ranks photos vs. text *within* a page based on query context.|Supports idea of Google picking *chunks* of content based on user intent. Think AI Overviews or how Featured Snippets are selected.|
|**Score Adjustment for Youth-Oriented Content** (US 10,671,616 B1)|Modifies search result scores based on whether the content is youth-friendly.|Shows query-level intent shifts rankings. Could mean age-related, demographic, or even sensitivity filters are applied.|
|**Ranking Based on Social Interactions** (US 10,630,763 B2)|Boosts content that’s interacted with by people you're close to (friends/followers).|Suggests relationship graphs or behavior networks might affect result prominence.|
|**Device Context-Based Ranking** (US 10,685,029 B2)|Adjusts ranking depending on user’s device (battery level, screen, audio output, etc.).|Implies that search isn’t just about the query. It’s about the *environment*. A slow connection could mean video results get suppressed.|
|**Engagement-Based Quality Score** (US 10,565,267 B2)|Creates a content score based on user interaction (dwell time, clicks, etc.).|Arguably the most direct suggestion that behavior metrics impact rankings.|
|**Detecting Narrow vs. Broad Appeal** (US 10,877,982 B1)|Distinguishes between niche vs. broad audience engagement patterns.|Could explain why some content doesn’t “scale” in rankings even when users love it. Popularity may need *broad appeal*.|",r/SEO,2025-07-27T14:26:30.000Z,post,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you guys think Google is using user engagement, device context, and content appeal (not just relevance/authority) as direct or indirect ranking signals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextual Ranking of Photos and Text&lt;/strong&gt; (US 10,671,660 B2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Ranks photos vs. text &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a page based on query context.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Supports idea of Google picking &lt;em&gt;chunks&lt;/em&gt; of content based on user intent. Think AI Overviews or how Featured Snippets are selected.&lt;/td&gt;

"Strange Issue After Core Update and Google News Approval - No Referring Page, Plus more...

  
On June 26th, the website was finally added to Google News after 15 months. We know this by checking  GNews itself for the site, and it lists us, and we are now listed as ""Source""; all of our articles appeared in GNews and Top Stories. You can Google News Site:name and also site: name (notice the space after site: ) 

Google Core Update happened on June 28th, and on July 4th, we saw a drastic change in our appearance on Google News, along with a drop in Core Web Vitals, showing fewer and fewer indexed pages. Since then, the Core Web Vitals error has been fixed.

Since July 4th, indexing has been slowed. 2-3 hours per article. Articles will appear in Top Stories. Articles will eventually appear in Google News, but no article will show past page 3. Furthermore, if we do go to Tools - Sort by Date, the article will show in GNews at the top. 

  
Also, if we just do a regular search for the website, nothing shows up for a few pages, and after a few pages, we then have hundreds of articles appear, unless we sort by date, which shows our most recent articles in order.

We still rank in the top spot on regular Google searches, and we have not lost any impressions. Our impression rate has gone up to around 125K daily. Clicks from search have not changed at all.

Lastly, when we check GSC 80% of our newish articles now show Referring Page - Non Detected. This has only happened since July 4th. Before the 4th, articles would index instantly, and always had a referring page.

Thoughts: We must be doing something right if we just got approved to be a Google News Source and be shown in News and Top Stories. We still show in Discover and get clicks from it. How can a site be good enough to get into Google News and Top Stories and then be hit with the Core Update a few days later?

From June 26th until July 4th, we started seeing real Google News Clicks in GSC. Now we are lucky to get 1 or 2 daily, which I know could be for any reason, but it is because the articles aren't being seen on page 1.

Now, I’m not here to say they’re being overly dramatic (because I genuinely don’t know!), but… surely there’s a way to launch a new site without throwing years of SEO work into the abyss?

Both the current site and the new one are built in WordPress. I'm familiar with meta descriptions, tags, and as part of our SOPs the URLs are always matched to the old site so there aren't any issues there (Also plan to import/export all their blogs to the new site). But when it comes to redirects, URL structure, and whatever secret sauce you all work with, I’m 100% out of my depth.

So I’m here looking for some advice:

* What should I ask or coordinate with the SEO vendor to make this a smooth transition?
* Are there common mistakes to avoid when launching a redesigned site so we don’t tank their rankings?
* Should we be looking at tools, plugins, or audits before going live?

My #1 priority is making sure the client keeps whatever traction they’ve built. Any tips or even “don’t do this!” horror stories would be super appreciated. Thanks in advance!",r/SEO,2025-07-24T15:43:37.000Z,post,Help,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey SEO pros 👋&lt;/p&gt;

"I see GSC being recommended as a rank tracking option a lot on Reddit and it's awful advice.  
  
Here’s why:  
  
𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 ≠ 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥: GSC’s “Average Position” isn’t a fixed rank... it’s an aggregate of all searches over time.   
  
If one user saw you at 2 and another at 8, GSC might show an average like 5.0.   
  
That number blurs reality. You never actually sat at 5; it’s just maths. Real rank trackers show you the exact position at a given time.  
  
No averaging fuzziness.  
  
𝐒𝐄𝐑𝐏 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐒𝐤𝐞𝐰 𝐈𝐭: GSC counts all search features as “positions.”   
  
If your page shows in a local 3-pack or a Featured Snippet, Search Console might report you at Position 1… even if your actual organic listing was lower.   
  
So your site might average at 1.1 because of a maps listing, while the organic result sits around 8th.   
  
GSC basically treats a fancy box (maps, AI answer, PAA, etc.) as taking up a rank slot.   
  
Rank trackers, on the other hand, let you see true organic rank (and whether you’re in those features separately).  
  
𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 &amp; 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Your “rank” can vary by location and user.   
  
GSC lumps data across countries or devices unless you filter deeply. It’s country-level at best. No city or post/zip code precision. If you’re big in local SEO, GSC won’t tell you how you rank in your city versus elsewhere.   
  
A dedicated tracker can check from a specific location, so you know where you really stand.  
  
𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐁𝐢𝐚𝐬: GSC only records a position when someone actually sees your result.   
  
If you quietly sit at page 5 but nobody goes that far, GSC shows nothing. Or it looks like your average rank is higher than it truly is.   
  
In other words, no impressions ≠ no ranking. Third-party trackers catch those unseen rankings too, so you’re aware of every keyword, not just the ones that get clicks.  
  
𝐍𝐞𝐰 𝐀𝐈 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐬: With Google’s new AI-powered answers, things get crazier. If your site is cited in an AI answer, Search Console counts that...  
  
But it shoves all those AI citations into one position. It’s recorded as a top spot impression, even though it’s not a traditional blue-link ranking.   
  
This makes the 'average position' murkier than ever.  
  
Google Search Console is awesome for trend analysis and click data, but it was never built to be a precise rank tracking tool.   
  
Its data is aggregated, delayed and affected by features that distort what “rank” really means. If you need to truly know where you stand in the SERPs, by location, in plain organic, right now, you’ll want a dedicated rank tracker (yes, the kind built for that job).

"**Problem**  
My 100+ keywords are positioning very low on Google (0 in Top 3) Vs Bing (50 in Top 3).

**Context**  
I track 100 or so keywords on Semrush that convert visitors. My positioning on Google has never been great, but this latest update greatly reduced our visibility.

* On Google, with the latest June 2025 Google core update, I have lost a tremendous amount positioning, top 3 (10-&gt;0) and top 10 (30-&gt;10), etc.
* On Bing, it's the opposite, I have 50 keywords in Top 3, 75 in top 10, and 90 in top 20. Nearly any time we post pages, they will shoot to top 10 on Bing without question.

We also have 1k+ pages that rank very well on Google/Bing but are unrelated to our business. Many of those unrelated pages have many great backlinks which has brought up out DA (according to Semrush) to nearly 40. Some of our pages within the 100 keywords have backlinks, but not as strong. One *guess* could be that Google sees those pages as a different topical authority now in the last update whereas Bing doesn't.

**Note**  
I know this question has been posted several times in the past on this subreddit but I haven't seen this amount of disparity between the two engines in previous posts. I would very much appreciate any feedback, troubleshooting tips, or next steps this community could provide.

"Hi r/SEO,

I work at a company that invested a lot of time and $ in upgrading their website at the beginning of the year, and the site looks and seems to function much, much better. We are in the mid-market and enterprise B2B SaaS and hardware space. 

The agency we worked with to redesign and republish the site was very skilled, but now we are looking to move on to SEO and trying to figure out where to start.

**Tech stack:**

* Webflow + Webflow CMS for hosting
* SurferSEO for content assistance
* Ahrefs

**Basic data from ahrefs:**

* DR: 26 (competitors are in the mid- to high-40s)
* Referring domains: 90 (competitors are much, much higher - typically hundreds)
* Total visitors: 1.7K
* Organic Traffic: 261

When we look at our competitors and their data (at least on ahrefs), we seem way behind.

We started reworking some pages (8 of about 90 or so) using Surfer and within a few weeks, GSC shows our traffic increasing, so this seems like a good sign. But there are tons of pages to work on and we're not sure if we should keep going with it internally or hire in a consultant to help to help us develop a good strategy to work through this and understand if we are missing anything.

So for all the experts out there, the question is this -- where do we start? what will generate the most results the fastest?

"Hi folks,

I run a (B2B/industrial) website that I built myself—call it “vibe-coded” with some programming chops + AI guidance.

**What I’ve already done (AI-assisted):**

* On-page basics: titles, metas, H1/H2 hierarchy, keyword targeting
* Internal link structure &amp; topical clusters (at least a first pass)
* XML sitemap + robots.txt + Search Console setup
* Basic schema (Organization/Product/FAQ)
* Core Web Vitals fixes via Lighthouse/GSC suggestions
* Content cadence: a couple of blog posts/month, intent-focused, AI-drafted then edited by me
* Google Ads: set up campaign, negative keywords, conversion tracking, landing pages

**Time &amp; Results:**

* \~2 hours/week on SEO/Ads combined
* Rankings: slow upward trend for core keywords (from page 3–4 to 1–2 for some long tails)
* Ads: acceptable CPC/CPA (for now), conversions trickling in

**The Big Question:**  
What does a *good* SEO agency or consultant typically do that I’m *not* doing (or can’t replicate with AI + elbow grease)? At what point do I pull in a pro? 

Not trying to self-promote—just genuinely want to understand the delta between “DIY + AI” and “pro-grade” SEO.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I’ve already done (AI-assisted):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-page basics: titles, metas, H1/H2 hierarchy, keyword targeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal link structure &amp;amp; topical clusters (at least a first pass)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML sitemap + robots.txt + Search Console setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic schema (Organization/Product/FAQ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core Web Vitals fixes via Lighthouse/GSC suggestions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content cadence: a couple of blog posts/month, intent-focused, AI-drafted then edited by me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Ads: set up campaign, negative keywords, conversion tracking, landing pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time &amp;amp; Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~2 hours/week on SEO/Ads combined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rankings: slow upward trend for core keywords (from page 3–4 to 1–2 for some long tails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ads: acceptable CPC/CPA (for now), conversions trickling in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Big Question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
What does a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; SEO agency or consultant typically do that I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing (or can’t replicate with AI + elbow grease)? At what point do I pull in a pro? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not trying to self-promote—just genuinely want to understand the delta between “DIY + AI” and “pro-grade” SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

"Hello everyone! Just wanted to share a new SEO update because this community has helped me so much. I posted here a few months back about taking SEO more seriously for my Boston-based video production company, and the response was honestly so kind that I wanted to post again with updated results and more gratitude. I also wanted to just circle back to shed some light on things that have been working really well for me in the last three months!

I'm now about 16 months into the real SEO grind - consistent blogging, optimizing titles and H1s, internal linking, structured data - all that good stuff.

Before I jump in, I do want to mention that I have some photos from Google Search Console below so that you can see the journey. Also, I know it's not all about impressions - we've been booking a lot of gigs via google search and this all has lead to more clicks!

So back in March(ish) when I posted I mentioned that I was doing the following:

* Writing blog posts that got attention on google
* Building individual service pages for everything we do
* Using Google Search Console and GA4 to figure out what was working
* Fixing technical stuff in Squarespace
* Learning how to write and inject structured data. To be honest, I use chatGPT to help me write this code. I then take it to Google Rich Results and test it and go back and forth with ChatGPT to make sure it's perfect.
* Internally linking like a maniac
* Getting every client to leave a Google review
* Asking other video production companies around the country to take meetings with me and learn more about who they are. If we think we're a good partner to work together on something in the future we will both write a really detailed blog about one another for backlinks. I'm very careful about this and admit that backlinks are my weakest subject
* Updating our Google Business Profile weekly with posts and photos

Since then I have seen a lot of growth, specifically around May. This huge jump has made me wonder what I'm doing differently. I think I can credit the recent growth to the following:

* A **few blogs that have really hit it off** \- these are gear related blogs that have a lot of traffic. Are they potential clients? no but I think it is helping with authority!
* I have been **implementing schema code** on all our pages and every single blog I write!
* **consistency**
* **I changed my home page title** from ""Boston Based Video Production | Bunker Hill Media"" to ""Bunker Hill Media: Video Production That Drives Proven Engagement"" and I think this is helping with clicks. IMO, I love that title because it's true!

I feel like I’m learning something new every day, especially when it comes to backlinks (still my weakest area). But this community has made SEO feel way less intimidating and way more collaborative!

I think the one thing I'm scared of a bit now is that I'm noticing I'm dipping in rankings. I seem to be staying right around the same place for what I want to be there for ""video production in Boston"" - right around 4-7 on google (up from 90th last year!). But working on keeping that up and improving CTR!

* Prevent spam and low-value posts from harming the site’s authority
* Maximize organic search traffic and user engagement over time
* Handle potential duplicate content issues from user submissions
* Optimize for long-term growth despite niche challenges

Has anyone worked on similar open publishing platforms or UGC-heavy sites? What SEO approaches have worked best in your experience, especially in tough or competitive verticals?

Any insights or resources would be greatly appreciated!

"Hi everyone,

I have an question about keywords and URLs. Although I work in marketing, I'm not very knowledgeable about SEO. Right now, I'm assisting a friend with her website.

The company is a local, service-based business that provides facility cleaning services (Gebäudereinigung) in Berlin, Germany.  The current domain is ""brandname - cleaning TLD"" . However, compared to ""facility cleaning"", the term ""cleaning"" is rather broad and might be used to describe anything from laundry services to automobile detailing to house cleaning. It doesn't seem to be directly related to facility cleaning as a service.

So, the domain seems a little ambiguous to me.

If the keyword ""facility cleaning services"" were prominently displayed in the domain and aligned with the H1/H2, I think the SEO may be enhanced. I'm thinking of registering a more specialized domain, such as ""brandname - facilitycleaningservice TLD,"" because of this.

The current domain is active since 2017, the website receives very little traffic. In Google Search Console, the website is ranked approximately at position 44. Since I started improving the site, it has improved by four positions.

Whats the take on this from a professional SEO? 

Should I purchase a new domain such as "" brandname -  facilitycleaningservice TLD "" to more accurately reflect the service?

What would be the best practice if I do proceed with a new domain?

Do I simply replace the domain in WordPress?

Or would it be wiser to install a fresh WordPress on the new domain, migrate the old site onto it, and redirect from the old domain?  
My thinking is, a fresh install cloud give the site a algorithmic boost, as it would be seen as ""new.""

"Hello!


Context:

I've been working as a backend java developers for several years and I'm working in a side project. It's a web that aims to have the best agenda of concerts in Spain. My backend tracks concerts everyday from several ticketing webs. Everything is still WIP, but at least is somewhat useful now. I use nextjs for the frontend and Java + Springboot for the backend


I only track concerts in Madrid, but planning to scale to all main Spanish cities in the future. Also you can filter concerts by music genre. I thought it would be good to generate different ""links"" for each genre, such as ""/genre/metal"", ""/genre/rock"", etc. Each page is very similar (I put custom title, description and h1s for each page) except the list of concerts changes, which would be different for each genre. Each of these pages right now is aiming for search results like ""metal concerts in Madrid"". I actually saw an increase of impressions in search console, going from 0-10 a day to 30-40 a day.


As I'm planning to include other cities than Madrid, would it make sense to make a different Page for each city? And if yes, would it make sense to create different pages for each genre for each city? Example: ""/madrid/metal"", ""/madrid/rock"", ""/barcelona/rock"", etc?


Edit: Would it make sense as well to make pages for each concert venue? Or at least the ones with most events? I'm scared Google may detect that as duplicated content


I don't care too much if I got to change any links and loose some of my advances in search console as this is pretty new and I know It takes time. Also this is just a side project, so I don't expect much from It apart from learning and using It myself (I love live metal concerts)

"Hey everyone — hoping someone here can help me understand what’s going on. I’ve been battling with indexing and traffic fluctuations for weeks, and I’m starting to suspect something deeper is wrong.

Context

I run a competition discovery site for CrossFit athletes, launched 3 months ago. Here’s the evolution:

• Originally launched with:  
• www subdomain  
• .html extensions on detail pages  
• Then I migrated to Vercel and:  
• Removed www  
• Removed .html from URLs  
• Later, I restructured pages from /competitions/slug → /competitions/details/slug for better organization  
• I also introduced country/region/city pages under paths like

/competitions/crossfit/united-kingdom/england/chesterfield

But I made a mistake:  
In my sitemap, I accidentally included redirect URLs like:

       {
       source: '/competitions/:sport/:country/:region',
       destination: '/competitions/:sport/region/:country/:region',
       } 

…so Google crawled both the canonical and the redirect version. And to make it worse, the &lt;link rel=""canonical""&gt; was pointing to the homepage for a while ...

✅ What I’ve fixed

• The sitemap now only includes canonical URLs (no redirect versions).  
• Canonical tags are correct.  
• The site is fast and indexable (Next.js with pre-rendered pages, SSG).  
• Sitemap returns 200, looks valid, and is fetched regularly by Google (every few days).  
• Robots.txt is correct: allows all bots, sitemap declared properly.

🚨 The weird issue now

1 Google traffic pattern: spike, then total drop

• I consistently get a 3–5 day spike in impressions (1,000+ impressions / 50+ clicks per day)  
• Then, traffic drops to near-zero for 2–3 days — even when I haven’t deployed anything

This pattern repeats and has been happening for weeks.

2 Vercel Deploy = instant traffic death (it seems)

• When I push a site update (even a small one), Google traffic drops to zero within the hour  
• Sitemap is regenerated at deploy (with upz

I checked:

• Vercel builds properly.  
• The sitemap regenerates with fresh lastmod dates (new Date().toISOString()).  
• Pages don’t disappear from the index — they just lose all impressions.

⸻

My questions:

• Could the lastmod being updated on every deploy make Google suspicious and reduce crawl/prioritize re-evaluation?  
• Does Vercel deploy behavior (full rebuild, cache invalidation?) mess with how Google treats the site temporarily?  
• Is this normal for newer sites, or a sign of deeper trust/indexing issues?  
• How long does it take for Google to “settle” after URL structure changes and sitemap cleanups?

"I posted a few weeks ago about losing my clients as SQLs fell off a cliff with ai overviews and their site getting slammed in Dec 24 and Mar 25 core updates.

"Hi everyone, I'm very new to SEO, but I'm doing what I can to learn. I'll cut straight to it.

My dad owns a mexican snack/chip company similar to chicharrones. Think takis or sabritones, but there's 0 pork. 2 flavors are vegan and 1 is vegetarian. He regularly sells out at farmers markets in a major US city, but that's also due to him being a great salesman. He really wants to stay true to the Mexican identity. I think the two audiences we should be targeting are

1. Health conscious eaters
2. Families with kids.

Why? Well, chicharrones are known for containing pork and thus, a lot of people won't ever buy them. But, our product is really good, shelf stable, and a great alternative for those who can't do pork. Also, the bags are resealable, so this can be a great snack for kids that's not loaded up with bad ingredients and doesn't have to be eaten all at once.

Now, as someone who's trying to piece together the puzzle that is SEO, this is where I think I should start.

**1. Build a website with a blog.**

* focus on long tail keywords.
   * “healthy kid snacks for school”
   * “vegetarian Mexican snacks”
   * “healthy shelf stable snacks”
   * “spicy Mexican snacks
   * Mexican snacks for parties”

**2. Blog Content Plan (1500–2000 words each)**

* *Topic Ideas*:
   * “Top 10 Healthy Mexican Snacks Your Kids Will Love”
   * “Takis vs. **Company Name** A Spicy Showdown”
   * “How to Build the Perfect Back to School Lunch Box (with **Company Name**)""

**3. Collaborate with influencers and other blogs**

* Mom Tiktok
   * Mom videos of them building school lunches for kids and have them include our product.
* Construction Worker Tiktok
   * Not sure if anyone is familiar with this trend, but basically a bunch of construction workers show off their lunches. Typically it's full course meals from the guys wives, and a bologna sandwich for the white guys lol. Anyways, I'd love to send them product and have them include it in their videos
* Vegetarian/Vegan Influencers
   * Collab with other blogs or influencers and backlink to eachother if possible

(we're also in the process of setting up our Tiktok shop, its a pretty difficult process for some reason)

Is any of what I'm saying on track? I feel a bit lost in the space, but I'm fascinated and excited to work in SEO. I just want to do my part in the family company, and I think this can be it. Would love any advice I can get!!

"Hey everyone,  
I'm doing some market research around SEO and AI-generated content.

Here’s the idea I’m exploring:  
Let’s say an SEO agency embeds a small widget on its site. Visitors enter their brand name, email and get a free report that analyzes how visible they are in AI-generated content (like ChatGPT, Bard, etc.), including scoring and simple charts. And then you receive the lead (email + full report + scoring and maybe phone).

I’m curious:

* Do you think brands care about how they appear in AI-generated results?
* Would offering a free prompt visibility report help SEO agencies attract more leads?
* Have you seen anything like this before?

This is what I did so far:

1.) Each Page created, I can easily manipulate the HTML Links for Titles, Alt Image tags, and Image performance. Example. If I upload a PNG, the Python script automatically converts it to .webp and resizes and makes appropriate changes on the page. 

2.) Title and Meta tags are easily edited. In fact, I'm working on OpenAI addon that will do that automatically.

"Hi everyone,

I’m managing SEO for a long-established addiction rehab center (focused on drug, alcohol, and substance abuse — not tobacco). The site has existed for years and performed well in Google Search, but after a recent rebuild, we’ve observed unexpected changes in performance.

**What happened:**

At the end of January 2025, we rebuilt the site using Elementor due to technical limitations in the previous setup (WordPress as well) — mainly the inability to manage URL structure and content hierarchy.  
The visual design, layout, and content structure remained the same.

**Shortly after the rebuild:**

* Impressions increased significantly.
* At the same time, average positions dropped.
* As a result, clicks decreased sharply.

Screenshots:

Impressions vs. Average Position  
https://i.imgur.com/KGaXFuY.png

Impressions vs. Clicks  
https://i.imgur.com/848L9Oz.png

**What we changed during the rebuild:**

* Expanded and improved content on key pages.
* Merged overlapping pages to resolve content cannibalization.
* Simplified the category structure for better crawlability.
* No major changes to page content or layout were made — only structural improvements.

**Our concerns:**

* Is it possible that Google is still re-evaluating the new structure, even though most of the content remained the same?
* Could Elementor’s frontend output (JavaScript, HTML structure, CLS issues) affect crawlability or ranking signals?
* Is this behavior consistent with sitewide quality reassessment?
* Any chance the URL changes alone caused a temporary or lasting disruption?

We’d appreciate any input or guidance from Google team members or experienced users.

"# TL;DR

* **Paid ChatGPT search uses Google Search.**
   * A dummy page indexed *only* in Google showed up in ChatGPT Plus results within hours.
   * The same query in Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. still returns zero results.
* **Free ChatGPT ≠ Google** ***or*** **Bing.** Its results barely overlap with either engine - likely OpenAI’s own experimental index.
* **Query-overlap test:** on 50 queries, domain overlap with Google is \~70 % vs &lt;30 % with Bing; snippet-token overlap tells the same story.
* **OpenAI’s docs list “Bing &amp; Shopify” as third party search partners but never mention Google.**
* For SEOs that means: *ranking in Google is now a prerequisite for ranking inside ChatGPT answers.*

**Proof #1 - Sting-page proof**

1. I coined a nonsense word.
2. I then put it on a page **not linked anywhere**.
3. Forced Google to index it via Search Console; left all other engines unaware.
4. Asked ChatGPT Plus to define the term → it *quoted my hidden page verbatim*.
5. Ran the same query in Bing, DDG, Yandex → no results

**The only place ChatGPT could have found the page was Google’s index.**

**Proof #2 - Overlap analysis**

**Method:** captured ChatGPT’s own search calls via DevTools → ran identical queries in Google &amp; Bing → compared domain lists + tokenised snippets.

|:-|:-|:-|
|**Search-result overlap** (domains)|**0.72**|0.28|

36% of the queries had a snippet token overlap of &gt; 80% with Google. Its extremely unlikely that any other search engine can have such a high snippet token overlap with Google.

What this means for SEO

* **Privacy.** Paid users’ prompts are silently routed to Google servers, despite no public partnership announcement.
* **Free ChatGPT = peek into a new search engine.** Its divergent results hint at OpenAI dog-fooding an in-house search engine (good news if you’re betting on “third index” diversity).

"# TL;DR

* **Paid ChatGPT search uses Google Search.**
   * A dummy page indexed *only* in Google showed up in ChatGPT Plus results within hours.
   * The same query in Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. still returns zero results.
* **Free ChatGPT ≠ Google** ***or*** **Bing.** Its results barely overlap with either engine - likely OpenAI’s own experimental index.
* **Query-overlap test:** on 50 queries, domain overlap with Google is \~70 % vs &lt;30 % with Bing; snippet-token overlap tells the same story.
* **OpenAI’s docs list “Bing &amp; Shopify” as third party search partners but never mention Google.**
* For SEOs that means: *ranking in Google is now a prerequisite for ranking inside ChatGPT answers.*

**Proof #1 - Sting-page proof**

1. I coined a nonsense word.
2. I then put it on a page **not linked anywhere**.
3. Forced Google to index it via Search Console; left all other engines unaware.
4. Asked ChatGPT Plus to define the term → it *quoted my hidden page verbatim*.
5. Ran the same query in Bing, DDG, Yandex → no results

**The only place ChatGPT could have found the page was Google’s index.**

"I'd like some assistance to make sure what I'm doing is the correct path.

Or if I've missed something very obvious.

I've been reading this sub, using ahrefs/etc (free version) tools to learn about it, to make sure I had a solid foundation before posting.



So the site has history. It was first online in 2001



I made a parody car parts website. Through no effort of my own, It went viral.

I had first result for most of my parody products, and first page for everything else. 

No SEO work, no effort. It just did. Early internet, right? 

I mostly put no effort in after 2015 or so. By 2019 it still got 10k/mo unique.

It was hacked in 2019 and I just let it stay offline until this year.



This year, I remade the site in Wordpress. Added some low effor articles too, which I'll be expanding later.

Made a new FB page to post ""ads"" for updated versions of my product. 1-2 a week that link back to my site.

It's pulling 800/mo unique visitors presently.



Used an SEO plugin to set all my meta titles and descriptions, alt texts.

Sent sitemap to google/etc.



This allowed me to fire up adsense (which I still need to work on a lot more, it's been super obnoxious with ad placement, even in no no areas) My goal is a fun website that pays for itself, monetization is a low priority.



Per search console, 80% of clicked search terms were people looking directly for my site.

I found 4 terms related to my products in the first few pages.



Updated my site to weave those terms in more frequently.



For indexing, I started cross-linking products.  For example, in product A it says it's ""compatible with product b (link)"" and then B to A as well.





So then, backlinks:





**Google**:

External links / backlinks

3726



\#1 site is a car forum,

\#2 is reddit,

\#3 and on are many more car forums.



I'm also aware of several online car journal/news sites that have linked, but they don't show up in these lists.



**Ahrefs:**

Domain rating 29

14k Backlinks 77% dofollow

1.1k Linking Websites 63% dofollow



Most of these backlinks are very old. I used the ahrefs report and found that most of the existing links went to product pages from the preious site.

So i went in and built 301 redirects that would send the users to the new version of the product.

I also made a catchall redirect that found anything not covered, and went to a new page I built that listed every classic product along with its original copy.  
  
My current plan is to keep posting on socials. (Only Facebook has gained any traction)   
I'll keep writing articles.  
And obviously I'll flood my site with more goofy car products.  


Am I missing something else here? (Perhaps patience)

"Been a f-lancer for many, many years. Had a pretty bad injury a few years back so took an SEO job recently at a well known Digital marketing agency and i'm stunned at their lack of knowledge/ skills. Are all agencies like this?

1. Digital marketing manager has only a basic understanding of meta data, that's it.
2. 1x junior assistant responsible for all dm project tasks/ reporting
3. Web dev builds sloppy, slow template websites in WordPress, sell for ($x,xxx)
4. Clients on the books for 3 years that aren't even setup on search console
5. One campaign is 7 years old and is not even ranking on Google
6. No link building (risky), no content unless they pay more (and then they get AI slop), no new pages (unless they pay more)
7. Basic keywords research (anything slightly relevant with traffic)
8. Just monthly reports and random 'tasks' to look busy w/ no results for **years**

I have never been so embarrassed during a client call, the lack of knowledge on our side of the conversation. I had to chime in over two levels of management to explain the purpose of canonical tags (one of which was the Digital marketing manager of 10 years). I expected 6 professionals to wipe the floor with a single f-lancer but their just a bunch of disorganised people that don't know anything outside of their direct task or how it relates to other tasks, or even seem to care.

"So this is a whinge post lol

I've worked in SEO for 8+ years. Agencies, in house, freelance, couple of my own projects etc. 

I had an old colleague come to me like ""hey we have a client needs help with a small D2C ecom many to one migration project, and they're building a new site"". Sweet easy, happy to help. 

I gave high level scope, quote and timeline. About 25 hours work.

After answering a bunch of questions via email over 3 months (unusually needy client) but essentially presales, it all sounds good to go and we hop on a kickoff call. Recap scope and reshare key contacts, and tee up a chat with the we design agency. So far so good. 

Then dropped. 

Clients reason? The other SEO who they've been chatting with is way more clued up with the AI technicals 🙄

I'd love to know what crystal ball AI mysticism they were sold on. Maybe a ""cosine similarity audit"", maybe we'll include ""schema embeddings analysis"" within our migration project plan to make sure AI bots can read your site. Lol cool whatever bro.

Anyway, just pissed that I wasted 4 hours replying to emails, and lost the job to some AI snake oil. Also a little unprofessional that client dipped so late after agreeing to go ahead and I'd sunk in some time.

I'm in a fortunate inhouse position where I get good pay and love my day job, getting incredible SEO growth for a big ecom site, employer treats us well. Thought I'd help out the little guy and do an old workmate a freelance favour. Thought this was an easy job. 

Like asking a builder to build a deck, doesn't seem too complicated, a little bit of work, but theres some important stuff to get right.

"# TL;DR

* ChatGPT only searches when **uncertain** or when the user explicitly nudges it (“look up…”, “latest…”, “near me”).
* Phrases like **“best” / “top” / current-year “2025” / “reviews”** appear in \~30 % of the AI-generated search queries
* For well-trodden topics (“how many fingers”, “cheapest WordPress hosting”) it skips search and answers from memory.
* There’s a dedicated classifier internally (dubbed`sonic_classifier_ev3`) that flips the *search / don’t search* switch.
* Before the query leaves the LLM it’s **translated**: adds year + location + authority terms (“who”, “cdc”), strips filler words, and preserves the noun/adjective “spine.”

When you ask ChatGPT (or Gemini or Claude) something, it does one of the following things:

1. **Instant recall** – Provides answers immediately from training data (like “`how many fingers on each hand`“)
2. **Reasoning** – Thinks through a problem step-by-step (like “`how many fingers do 7 people have total`“)
3. **Web search** – Looks up current information online (like “`who is the prime minister of Namibia`“)

**Understanding ChatGPT when search tool (option 3) is chosen -** 

It seems like there is a classifier (dubbed “`sonic_classifier_ev3`”) that does only one thing: decide when to invoke the search search engine and when to not. This classifier is likely trained to identify when queries can be answered based on ChatGPT’s training data vs not.

|explain drm free pc games statistics| “drm free pc games **market share 2025**”|
|top rated pikler triangle india| “pikler triangle **best reviews india**”; “pikler climber **buy india**”|

Frequency of newly injected ""booster terms"" added to the query by ChatGPT:

|No|Booster term|Count|Share of all queries (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|||||
|1|best|7|7.1%|
|2|2025|6|6.1%|

"Hi all,

I'm having trouble with keyword tracking for a company with lots of services and location pages. Some of their brands will have 8 locations across any given state in the US and offer 5 to 6 services. 

Not all locations have the same services. 

Services include ""kindergarten"", ""infant care"", ""daycare"", ""Montessori infant care"" etc.

The issue I'm having is whether to track the broad term, for example, ""infant care"" which has over 20k monthly search volume. Or to add in a location qualifier like ""Infant Care Minneapolis"" which only gets about 90 searches per month.

I don't believe users will include the city in the search like this because Minneapolis is huge. Additionally, they have 8 locations all over Minneapolis and St. Paul and other suburbs. But they have this one service page and separate location pages for each location.

I think users would just search ""infant care"" or ""infant care near me"" and Google will serve local results, but that seems too broad to target and/or track. And then the location qualifier doesn't feel right either.

I cannot create a service page for each location yet, that could come down the pipeline, but for now, I have to edit the service pages, each available across all 8 locations.

&lt;p&gt;I think users would just search &amp;quot;infant care&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;infant care near me&amp;quot; and Google will serve local results, but that seems too broad to target and/or track. And then the location qualifier doesn&amp;#39;t feel right either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot create a service page for each location yet, that could come down the pipeline, but for now, I have to edit the service pages, each available across all 8 locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help! I&amp;#39;m wracking my brain on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

"Anyone here on a revenue or profit share deal with their customer? What is a fair percentage to snip off, and should it come off the revenue or the profit per sale?

A bit more context:

I have an SEO client, they do nationwide service area contractor type work. They pay me to do SEO for that.

They recently launched an ecommerce wing, where they sell the same products that they install. I pitched to the customer we should do a revenue share / profit share instead of a retainer for just the ecommerce side, and keep the service based targeting on retainer.

He agreed, and we have a very trusting relationship. I want to pitch a fair rate, fair for both of us.

..... important consideration:

I see that a leading competitor selling the same products has an affiliate program where the commission is off of revenue (not profit), anywhere between 5% and 20% of the total sale price.. They must have custom percents for each product..

However, that affiliate program is fundamentally different from my deal.. I built the store on their website, using their brand. I don't have to create a new website from scratch and build trust / rankings out of thin air.

its a great gig. I get paid to do the SEO for the service stuff, and that all helps towards the ecomm / revenue share side too.

....... So given all of that info, I'm tentatively thinking that pitching 5% per sale off of top line revenue could be a fair value... that includes me building and running the whole ecommerce side as it relates to the website. building it, running it, managing inventory, adding/removing products, and implementing the SEO..

What do you think of 5%? Lifetime? i put a clause in there for ""lifetime"" with or without my management (for their service stuff that is. i'd be on the hook for running the store. but this just protects me in the rare case things ever go sour or they end up hiring some big wig agency or something years down the road).. That's a pretty big commitment from them i know, but i think its fair given the fact that im building the whole thing and investing lots of upfront time and money into it, all of which will reap the rewards for the years to come, with or without me.

Any industry standards in regards to percentages or terms? Anyone doing something similar?",r/SEO,2025-07-17T20:08:26.000Z,post,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone here on a revenue or profit share deal with their customer? What is a fair percentage to snip off, and should it come off the revenue or the profit per sale?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit more context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an SEO client, they do nationwide service area contractor type work. They pay me to do SEO for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They recently launched an ecommerce wing, where they sell the same products that they install. I pitched to the customer we should do a revenue share / profit share instead of a retainer for just the ecommerce side, and keep the service based targeting on retainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He agreed, and we have a very trusting relationship. I want to pitch a fair rate, fair for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;..... important consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that a leading competitor selling the same products has an affiliate program where the commission is off of revenue (not profit), anywhere between 5% and 20% of the total sale price.. They must have custom percents for each product..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that affiliate program is fundamentally different from my deal.. I built the store on their website, using their brand. I don&amp;#39;t have to create a new website from scratch and build trust / rankings out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;its a great gig. I get paid to do the SEO for the service stuff, and that all helps towards the ecomm / revenue share side too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;....... So given all of that info, I&amp;#39;m tentatively thinking that pitching 5% per sale off of top line revenue could be a fair value... that includes me building and running the whole ecommerce side as it relates to the website. building it, running it, managing inventory, adding/removing products, and implementing the SEO..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think of 5%? Lifetime? i put a clause in there for &amp;quot;lifetime&amp;quot; with or without my management (for their service stuff that is. i&amp;#39;d be on the hook for running the store. but this just protects me in the rare case things ever go sour or they end up hiring some big wig agency or something years down the road).. That&amp;#39;s a pretty big commitment from them i know, but i think its fair given the fact that im building the whole thing and investing lots of upfront time and money into it, all of which will reap the rewards for the years to come, with or without me.&lt;/p&gt;

The live desktop and mobile versions exhibit significantly different performance metrics. Live Desktop consistently shows high performance metrics (90+). Live Mobile is consistently in the mid-50s.  Additionally, staging has a relatively stable mobile performance measure of 84.

This is why I am puzzled. In my experience, performance metrics increase once the site is live. They do not decrease. What is also odd is that when page speed is tested inside the USA, the live mobile page speed is low (mid-50s). However, when page speed is tested by someone outside the USA, the live mobile page speed is high (90s). Desktop is consistently high whether staging or production. What might cause this to be the case? Which page speed should I trust? Is this a web host issue of some sort?

However, when page speed is tested by someone outside the USA, the live mobile page speed is high (90s). Desktop is consistently high whether staging or production. What might cause this to be the case? Which page speed should I trust? Is this a web host issue of some sort?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESPONSE from web host:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Do note that our support offices are in Europe, so if anything, the results should, technically, be worse when checked on our end, since your website is hosted in our Virginia datacenter. That said, the only difference I found in the analysis is in the &lt;strong&gt;Emulated Moto G Power with Lighthouse 12.7.1&lt;/strong&gt; section. In my analysis, the details provided are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unthrottled CPU/Memory Power: 784
CPU throttling: 1.2x slowdown (Simulated)
Screen emulation: 412x823, DPR 1.75
Axe version: 4.10.3

However, in your analysis, the details are the following:

Unthrottled CPU/Memory Power: 914
CPU throttling: 1.2x slowdown (Simulated)
Screen emulation: 412x823, DPR 1.75
Axe version: 4.10.3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only difference in these results is in the &lt;strong&gt;Unthrottled CPU/Memory Power&lt;/strong&gt;. Do note that we cannot say why &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; sets different values for tests done from different countries, which is something you may need to discuss with their support staff, as we have no control over how they operate.&lt;br/&gt;
###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking advice on next steps I might take. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
