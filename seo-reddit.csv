Google caught in their lies with leaked API docs ,"I’ve never been a fan of Rand Fishkin but he leaked Google api docs yesterday. Link in comment. He’s put a lot of misinformation out over the years. But I’ll say it 100 times. If you’re not keeping up to date with the algorithm you’re not doing SEO. 

Many of the things mentioned in the leaked documents that impacted ranking were things Google has said publicly via one of their parrots didn’t impact ranking. The only way you’d know is to put the tactics to the test. 

Stop listening to affiliate bloggers, John Mu and other idiots. Do your own tests. Measure. 

What Mike King did over at iPullrank is pretty impressive. Look it up. Read through the documents. 



KEY TAKEAWAYS:

    Google claimed they don't use a ""domain authority"" metric, but the docs show they totally do - it's called ""siteAuthority.""

    G said clicks don't affect rankings, but there's a whole system called ""NavBoost"" that uses click data to change search results.

    Google denied having a ""sandbox"" that holds back new sites, but yep, the docs confirm it exists.

    G assured us Chrome data isn't used for ranking, but surprise! It is.

    The number and diversity of your backlinks still matter a lot.

    Having authors with expertise and authority helps.

    Putting keywords in your title tag and matching search queries is important.

    Google tracks the dates on your pages to determine freshness.

    A lot of long-held SEO theories have been validated, so trust your instincts.

    Creating great content and promoting it well is still the best approach.

    We should experiment more to see what works, rather than just listening to what Google says.

"Here is How I find Zero Search Volume, low competition but high traffic potential","I was one of the people (the second after writer.com) who started AI content detectors back when ChatGPT was launched along with a tool called AI to human text converter. Both of these terms (and relevant others) have now millions in search volume.

These and countless other opportunities I have found over the years for me and my clients by using a simple yet effective keyword research strategy.

The more you research the better the outcome is.

I won't share any typical strategy like look into comp keywords blah blah

This method helps sites that are new, low authority, in a competitive niche and that want to target keywords that big sites don't have dedicated pages for.

So here is how this goes.

I start by using Google /Bing and Youtube Autocomplete to understand how people search for my topic. Let's say I'm researching ""coffee machines."" I'll type different combinations:

* ""what coffee machines""
* ""when coffee machines""
* ""how coffee machines""
* ""are coffee machines""
* ""why coffee machines""
* So on

This shows me the actual phrases people type into Google. For example, typing ""how coffee machine"" might show suggestions like ""how coffee machine works""

Next, I look at the Keywords Everywhere extension suggestions for each search. The extension shows additional keywords on the right side of Google results. I write down all unique keywords it suggests.

Then comes the key part - I take all these keywords and check them in Semrush. But here's what makes this method different: I specifically focus on keywords that Semrush shows as having zero search volume. These are often overlooked keywords that actually have search potential.

To verify this potential, I export these zero-volume keywords and put them into Google Keyword Planner. I'm looking for keywords that show:

* 10-100 monthly searches (or more)
* Year-over-year increase in searches

For example, a keyword like ""coffee machine pressure adjustment"" might show zero volume in Semrush but have 100 monthly searches in Keyword Planner with increasing interest.

As a final check, I look up these keywords in Google Trends, focusing on my target country. This helps me understand if there's consistent interest throughout the year. Sometimes you'll find keywords that spike during certain months - useful information for content planning.  You can also search up your keyword in reddit/X or similar platforms and see if users have shown interest around the topic.

Only after a keyword passes all these checks do I create content around it. This method helps find keywords that:

* Have actual search volume (confirmed by Keyword Planner)
* Show growing interest (year-over-year increase)
* Have less competition (since they appear as zero volume in Semrush)
* Show real user interest (verified by Google Trends)

I've found this method particularly useful for finding long-tail keywords that bigger websites often miss. These keywords might have lower search volume, but they often convert better because they're more specific to what users want.

A real example might help: Instead of targeting highly competitive keywords like ""best coffee machine,"" you might find that ""coffee machine water tank cleaning"" shows zero volume in Semrush but gets steady monthly searches in Keyword Planner, with increasing year-over-year interest.

In addition to finding keywords, when you finalise terms, before you write on those, you need to identify the relevant enitites that you need to mention. You can use tools like surferSEO or you can do it manually.

Here is how to do it manually.

\- Go to Google and type in ""refined KW.""

\- After you search, you might see bubbles or suggestions at the top or bottom of the search results. These are related queries that people often search for.

\- Click on one of these suggested queries.

\- Look at the new search results and note any important words or phrases you see. These might include specific features, brands, or types.

\- Go back to the original search and click on another bubble, and note down the key terms you find.

\- Gather all the important terms from the bubbles.

\- Group similar terms together to see what theme emerge. 

You can also see the theme of a particular SERP by analyzing the PAA. When writing down the content, you should answer these questions naturally throughout as these satisfies the user intent.

I hope this helps. I have other keyword research techniques but this one is relatively easy and implementable.",0.98,473,92,r/SEO,2024-12-23T12:51:01.000Z,post,,t3_1hkn3cl,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1hkn3cl/here_is_how_i_find_zero_search_volume_low/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1hkn3cl/here_is_how_i_find_zero_search_volume_low/,t2_8ajvjz39,Dazzle___,"The Reddit post is a detailed guide on how to identify keywords with zero search volume, low competition, but high traffic potential.

Google market share falls to lowest point in over 15 years...,"According to GS Statcounter, Google's market share is now 86.94%, the lowest percentage since they started recording search engine share in 2009. That equates to a more than 4% decline from the previous month, **the largest single-month drop recorded**, by far.

Even more impressive is the collapse in market share in their most important market, the United States. In April, Google had 77.46 of U.S. searches across all devices, **a massive drop of almost 10% from the previous month.** Over the same period, Bing has climbed to 13% market share in the U.S. and 5.8% globally (their highest market share since entering the search engine game in 2009).

Yahoo Search also seems to be doing surprisingly well out of all this with their share almost tripling to 3.09% worldwide (highest since July 2015).

While there is never going to be 100% consensus among the wider SEO community, I think many of us can agree that Google's search results have grown objectively worse over the past few years, a process of - potentially deliberate - enshitification that, in my opinion, has accelerated exponentially since the latest update. It has gotten so bad that for the first time in my over 10 years working in SEO, I am hearing average-joe internet users complain about the state of their search results on a daily basis.

It would seem that Sundar Pichai and his cronies believe Google's market dominance to be unassailable, regardless of how rotten their core product continues to grow, how many long-time employees they give the boot or jobs they ship overseas. As long as the stock continues to pump and Pichai can add himself to Billionaire row, that's what matters.

For all of you who have, up to now, believed that showing Google the middle finger is a gesture in futility, **these latest statistics prove that we can make our voices heard.** Imagine if the same happens this month (not an unreasonable idea) and Google loses a further 10% market share in its primary market. 90% market dominance might look invincible; shrink that to &lt;70% and Google might find themselves quickly regretting their near-sighted approach.

We have an opportunity now to send a message to Google. To tell them that we will not sit by idly while they destroy businesses and livelihoods; while they play the blame game and accuse *us* of being the ones who are producing a poor product that doesn't align with user intent; while they scrape our content to feed their AI machine and simultaneously lock us out from the SERPS; while well-researched, labor-intensive, and passion-infused blogs and articles are not even ranking in the top 100 but a generic Forbes article that mentions the KW once, a Reddit thread with single-digit upvotes and Quora spam dominates the top spots.

So tell your friends, tell your family, tell everyone you know that there are alternatives to Google. Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, it doesn't matter. Even if we only switch temporarily, to show that we will not accept this new status quo that they are trying to force upon us. Despite what their recent stock performance might lead you to believe, **Google has never been more vulnerable.** I, for one, am very interested to see what happens if Google loses as much market share in May as they did in April...",0.97,411,191,r/SEO,2024-05-02T11:49:14.000Z,post,,t3_1cidnwe,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cidnwe/google_market_share_falls_to_lowest_point_in_over/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cidnwe/google_market_share_falls_to_lowest_point_in_over/,t2_upod3itd,Altruistic_Angle5908,"The post discusses a significant shift in the digital marketing landscape, specifically focusing on Google's market share.

I Analyzed Canva's SEO Strategy and Found Something Interesting,"**TL;DR:** I analyzed Canva's SEO strategy - they're getting 700M+ traffic/month by optimizing for user problems rather than just keywords. Their product-led SEO approach focuses on ""jobs to be done"" instead of traditional keyword targeting.

# The Numbers:

* 700M+ total monthly visits
* 25% from organic search
* 2x Adobe's total monthly traffic
* Zero reliance on paid advertising

# Core Strategy Breakdown:

Instead of optimizing for generic terms, Canva targets specific user problems:

1. **User Intent Mapping:**
   * Target keywords like ""Create professional resume"" instead of ""resume maker""
   * Target keywords like ""Design Instagram post"" instead of ""social media tool""
   * Target keywords like ""Make wedding invitation"" instead of ""invitation designer""
2. **Technical Implementation:**
   * Template-level SEO optimization
   * Descriptive alt text for template library
   * Individual landing pages per design category
   * Immediate product access (no signup wall)
3. **Conversion Flow:**
   * Search on Google → Template Gallery → Instant Editor Access → Value Demo → Natural Signup

# Why This Works:

* Users get immediate value before hitting signup wall
* Product becomes the landing page
* High conversion due to demonstrated value
* 24/7 organic user acquisition

# Key Insight:

Their success isn't about traditional SEO metrics - it's about mapping search intent directly to product solutions.

I sorely miss Mat Cutts.,"To those who weren't in the SEO game before 2014: SEO and Google weren't always like this. The voices of the search engine weren't always ominous twats.

Matt Cutts was like your friendly SEO uncle, the fun one. I remember eagerly waiting for his Google Search Central videos because he would actually explain why (x) is good and why (y) might be bad, depending on the circumstance.

Shit went down back in the day too. About a year or two into my SEO journey, Penguin hit while I was working at an agency. My pot of clients tanked, removed from the listings.

I remember reading/watching his advice on how to recover - simple and straightforward (paraphrasing):

&gt; Hey scrub, contact webmasters of the spam links and try to get them removed. If they don't, use the disavow tool. But chill, you can recover from this, broham.

Compare that to today's crusty old 'Osiris' who responded to someone on Twitter asking what they should do after the HCU tanked their website and livelihood.

(Can't remember the exact quote from the screenshot I saw on SEroundtable, but this is close enough with the emoji)
&gt; Start a new website 🤷

Great advice... Fuck everything you did, fuck everything you thought you knew about SEO, fuck all the time you wasted, try again. We might fuck that up in the future because you're not demonstrating enough EEAT. Who knows, but I won't tell you or anyone why their website has shit the bed, cause fuck you, Google.

My niche is in finance, and surprisingly  haven't really been affected by all the recent updates. Why? I'd love to say it's the work I've done previously to integrate the brand within Google's knowledge graph, but honestly, who knows, I have competitors who have tanked that objectively do it better, have better link profiles and content seemingly produced by authorities in the industry.

What really does irk me is where we came from, to where we are now, we used to be a community of helpful individuals - probably due to Matt Cutts' welcoming and informative nature. We weren't alone. Someone at the top actively helped.

Instead, what we have now is a community of unhelpful tools who look down on others because their websites got lucky, like I did, and the people who can answer your questions(Crusty Osiris) will either ignore you, or ridicule you.

But what annoys me more, is the people at the top simply cannot be arsed to tell you what best practice is, besides shit that's been recited for over 15 years like it's new news.

It won't change, I'm not saying SEO is over, I'm saying we've been alone for a while Bois, and that's why I long for Matt Cutts.

Watching a business crumble has never felt so great,"The other day I was on my laptop and decided to take a glance at one of the companies I used to work with and see how things were going for them. To understand the situation this company was owned by a great guy named Bill and after some time in the industry Bill decided to retire and move on with his life which I'm happy for him because as I mentioned he was a great guy and he deserved it, so what's the problem here you may ask? Well, the guys/company Bill sold his company to were absolute Dbags and they were a company bent on just cutting costs and getting rid of everything that made the companies they acquired great in the first place whether that was the name, the programs, or the people and that's where I came into the fold.

Me and Bill had worked together for probably 2 years as he decided to take the risk of hiring me in my early infant stages of business as a one-man SEO agency which I could never thank him enough for. Things were always great even when times were rough and I knew that Bill understood that these things take time but were worth their weight in gold if done correctly so I gave it my all because I respected his patience and commitment to my work. Well, eventually those blocks and pieces did come together and we had a great strategy and you would think we would just run off into the sunset with the story ending there but after he sold the company I got an email requesting a meeting with the new company. The email told me to have all my SEO information ready to present to them and be prepared to answer any questions so I did exactly that.

I showed up for the Zoom call with my PowerPoint ready and we went through the entire thing with them stopping me every now and then to ask questions about the effectiveness and why I was doing what I was. Honestly, I thought things were going pretty well but once it all ended they asked me what my monthly rate was and I told them we had started at $700 a month but since then have grown into a rate of $1000 as the needs and size of the company have changed which honestly isn't that expensive in the grand scheme of things or at least I thought so until they said thank you we'll be in touch.... No more than a day later did I receive an email saying they would be moving on with another company unless I wanted to match their rate of $200 a month for SEO to which I didn't even entertain it with a response.

So back to my review of the site because they started by changing all the branding, URL's, and content which already I knew would cause problems, but who knows maybe they were onto something I wasn't. A quick Ahrefs crawl would also show a huge decline in overall keyword presence falling from well over 3,000 keywords to 250 keywords. But who am I to judge Ahrefs isn't an exact science so I humored myself by checking one last time if I was still attached to their Google Analytics and who would've guessed that they also left the codes in place for me to access the analytics. Lets just say revenues have tanked from organic search and after seeing all those metrics I couldn't be happier watching this heartless company tank. I do feel for those stuck with the company or who were let go but man it feels good to watch the ship crash and burn.

August Core Update is a Joke!,"First, avoid this thread if you are going to say 'wAiT fOr uPdAtE tO RoLloUt cOmpLetely', we heard that enough from Google's John Mu back in March. ***If you are a Google Apologist, please just ignore the thread***.

Google was pretty fast while shadow banning the websites back in March and back in September, took them what? 3 days? On the 5th of march, the update was announced, and most of the websites were shadow-banned by the 7th of March. All we heard was ""Wait for the update to rollout, then audit your website"" Do this do that, etc etc.

Since September, a lot of publishers have been complaining how they were losing the traffic and keywords with time. Alot of seos made some serious buck during the hcu update too claiming ""they can fix it"" and no recoveries, i know some publishers who literally deleted half of their blog so that they can recover, they claimed the classifier is running and if you make changes, your website can return, a lot of publishers were optimistic about the march update but it did the exact opposite, shadow banned the entire blogs.

A lot of people just kept mocking each other that your blog deserved it etc, but we all know now it was never about the content, AI paraphrased blogs are still ranking on top, hell even TikTok dominates your blog even when the video is entirely irrelevant there.

People started making changes to their blogs, I even created a new one started from scratch and grew it, I don't think Google understands how much effort content creation requires, because the content they create and the messages they convey are always vague. (a lot of people will disagree I know).

But they have never been clear about the helpful content update, then they just baked the hcu classifier to the core update, but never really conveyed what helpful content really is just ""Create content for users, not search"" sure that can be interpreted in many ways including not doing any SEO.

Fast forward to August, the core update was announced back in July and we all know the update was being tested already, too much volatility during the month of July and starting of August too, and then 15th of August they rolled out the update and a day passes, housefresh is back (good for them, I love them, they make really good content), I follow a lot of publishers on X. So day passed I saw a lot of publishers who were really vocal about their magazine and how they were wronged, started to recover. They didn't even make much changes to their content. One publisher I know who just left his blog completely and suddenly it revived yesterday.

I haven't seen any gaming or entertainment blog recover yet other than retro-dodo (who were vocal about their blog too). Some travel sites whose publishers were also vocal about their blogs and some entirely random blogs recovered.

Meanwhile, my website and plenty of others I know, our websites are now dying because of this August core update. Keywords just keep declining, it is no more about volatility, it is now straight-up murder in my niche (gaming). Social media posts with no context or Tiktoks with no context are now dominating the serps, especially in the USA region.

It now has come to this, be vocal, get attention, and recover (I don't hold anything against them, I support those bloggers) that they revealed what actually is going on in the serps.

But yeah sure, let's all wait for the update to completely roll out because that is what we can do anyway.

does buying backlinks actually worth the money? $200 to $300 per link is super expensive! ,"I'm concerned about the high costs of purchasing backlinks for SEO.

However, I have observed that some websites are able to rank using cheap, spammy backlinks purchased from platforms like Fiverr.

Google Updates are complete BS,"Let's talk about Google updates and why they are complete BS. As someone who has been in the search / internet marketing industry since 2008 the money grab and the greed that we now see from Google after covid times are insane. Google keeps trying to peddle this whole ""create quality content"" and ""look at us, we are fighting spam with spam updates and HCU"", and what do we see in the end? Site owners that pour their heart into their sites get hit, while BS AI spam, useless AI overviews that are so fking inaccurate, and parasite SEO strives. 

u/Google, honestly, WTF are you doing? What type of morons work there? eCommerce results are complete garbage with repetitive results from brand sites, which, in most cases, don't even carry the product. Forbes is now apparently a review site, and they are so good at reviewing everything, from printers to plumbers, movers, and service-based businesses, Google absolutely loves them.  


Sh\*t like seoinla . com has been ranking for keywords like ""SEO Los Angeles"" for over a year and passed every update, it must be great content and user experience, and they definitely fulfill user intent. Links like goo. gl/ maps/ KWrg4qPqKEN9mMer5 are now also ranking instead of the actual websites.

Hacked redirect spam rankings are at an all-time high, and that's probably the funniest thing to me. Imagine you create 100 good quality articles, it takes Google fking for EVER to index those. But as soon as your WP site gets hacked with Chinese redirect spam, OMG, Google gets a hard-on and will index those 1000s of pages in 24 hours. Can someone explain that to me? How stupid does your algorithm honestly have to be where it can't differentiate hacked pages vs the actual content? If my site is about T-shirts, and all of a sudden it gets hacked, and now I have 1000's of pages about p..rn and other BS, why algorithm doesn't throw a red flag and says, ""Wait a second, this site had only 100 pages yesterday about T-shirts, today they have 10,000 adult pages, something doesn't add up"", but instead, Google is like ""f\*k yeah, let's index those 10k pages and rank them for xxx videos, that seems legit"". 

u/google is losing it, well actually, lost it. They turned into a BS search engine that no longer puts users first, it's now more about how much money they can squeeze out of business owners and fill their pockets. They completely obliterated content publishers which they used to gain their dominance in the first place.

Google ads are also a complete sh\*t where the CPC and CPL are so high now that it's not even worth running those ads anymore. 

So dear u/google, go F yourself, since you are now completely useless to 90% of the publishers / small business owners.

And yes, the only way to do SEO now is to churn and burn AI spamming and blackhat since the dumbass Google algorithm can't differentiate between quality content and garbage.

"Unpopular Opinion: SEO isn't dead, you're just bad it...","This is going to hurt alot of feelings out there, but it seems like every year with the creation of some new tool like AI or with a Google update that causes someones blog to drop in ranking by 53% I hear the same thing over and over ""SEO is dead"" but I'm going to say that couldn't be further from the truth. 

Firstly, from a numbers standpoint SEO as a whole was valued at 1,789 million just two years ago and is expected to hit 6,685 million by 2028, take that along with the fact that click through rates for paid search campaigns were set on average around 2% with 5% being the higher end compared to organic search which was around 28-30% and you'll see that SEO is still reigning supreme time and time again despite all the naysayers. 

These numbers were for the people who don't care to hear my anecdotal arguments and if you don't agree with them I highly urge you to continue to look into them or argue with the hundreds of hours of research and industry expertise that go into them, on the other hand from a personal perspective I've ran campaigns for both paid ads and SEO, once again coming back to the same conclusion as my clients on both a national and local level have continued to see the most conversion and growth through their SEO campaigns. Like I said this might just be a personal thing, but I'm highly convinced SEO is here to stay and is even more important now than it ever has been despite all the sky is falling claims from people who just aren't good at their jobs.

- These agreements cover about half of all U.S. search queries, limiting competitors' market access and innovation potential.
- The judge noted that Google can raise text ad prices without competition, boosting revenue and securing further exclusive deals.

I was one of the publishers that attended the Google Web Creator Conversation Event,"We normally don't post much on Reddit but I know there's been a lot of chatter about the Google Web Creator Conversation Event.

As background, I'm not an SEO expert. I've been travel blogging for 12 years and have just had to pick up things along the way and try things - many of which are shared amongst the travel creator circles.

**BAD**

* Things are definitely not going back to before September 2023.
* The usual corporate-talk and not being able to speak about any specifics so in that regard, we really didn't get any answers.
* There's no timeline for a fix and no commitment to resolving our issues.
* Clearly would not speak about site-wide classifiers aka shadow ban.
* Could tell there was almost a shift in focus on trying to find band-aid solutions to the main problem of the ranking algorithm.
* Google is scared to make big changes because they're worried about breaking things or ""bad actors""/spammers.
* Very frustrating to hear ""it's probably not you..."" and ""keep creating good content and we'll catch up"". That's fine but many of us are out of business or are going to be soon.
* Realizing that Google Search team doesn't talk to Google Ads and some SERPs as well. The compartmentalization is real.

**GOOD**

* We now have a seat at the table. None of us ever thought we'd have a direct line to Danny.
* Speaking of Danny Sullivan, if you've ever met him, you'll know he's the most genuine and empathetic guy. I believe him when he says he's trying to advocate for us as ""small and independent publishers"".
* Probably first time they've put Google Search engineers in front of publishers. It was eye opening to see how they didn't really know how our business works and where we get our SEO advice from but they wanted to learn more. Ultimately, they wanted us to brainstorm ideas of how they can better support an ecosystem of real human creators.
* Could take this either way but it was interesting to learn how disconnected Search is to Ads in many ways. So when we challenged them with ""should we believe Mediavine/Raptive when they say that they're serving ""Google-approved"" amount of ads, they're not talking about Search.
* They're just now looking at building a better community for creators, similar to what YouTube has done. They admitted that traditionally, they've focused on SEOs but that could change/shift.
* Productive conversations about verified sites, better indicators of problems at a page/site level on Google Search Console, using photos as an indicator of authentic content, and highlighting our content through a carousel or some sort of blog toggle. There was lots to be debated about.
* We're essentially case studies and some of us also provided supplemental data for them to look into. Hopefully this means that the engineers will start debugging to try to find where the problems are. No guarantees of course.
* They're working on something but who knows what that is. What I do know is that they're open to learning, diagnosing, and investigating. Time will tell whether the changes will help us in a significant way.

So yes, I know some of the attendees felt like this was more like attending a funeral. I'd like to think that we were given a sliver of hope. Hope doesn't pay the bills though...

The AI Writing Revolution isn't coming... it's here,"After 10 years as a content writer and growth marketer, I can confidently say: the AI writing revolution isn't coming. It's here.

Over the past year or so, I've mostly dismissed AI writing. Largely because the output has been so robotic. But the last 2-3 months have completely changed my perspective, primarily due to my experiences with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and developing my own AI writing workflow.

**Here's what convinced me:**

1. Ranked on Google Page 1 with AI written articles for global SaaS companies to local small businesses (30 minutes with AI vs. 2-3 hours in the past)
2. Landing pages I've written with AI that convert at 20-40% (1 hour with AI vs. 3-5 hours in the past
3. Use Claude to write a newsletter trained in my voice that felt better and more unique than what I would've written (10 minutes with AI vs. 45 minutes in the past)

**My prediction:** There will be less and less complaints about how robotic and inhuman AI writing is over the next 6-12 months. And those who don't adapt will be left behind.

AI is going to make bad writers, average writers and average writers, world class writers. The difference maker is going to be those who learn how to see and use AI for what it is right now: a very powerful tool.

A chisel is just a tool, but when you put in the right hands with someone who knows how to use it, that tool can turn rock into the statue of David.

"SEO News: Google hosts Creators Event: small publishers left disappointed, Google AI Overviews rolled out to 100+ countries, New Senior Vice President of Knowledge &amp; Information at Google, Live Web Search in ChatGPT is here for paid and SearchGPT waitlist users, and more","***Updates***

Nothing official just yet.

However, there's evidence suggesting that one is on the way. This assumption is based on information shared during Google’s recent event for creators:

* **Google Hosts Creators Event**

For many attendees, the event felt more frustrating than inspiring. While Danny Sullivan aimed to offer support, Google’s main message to small publishers impacted by the September 2023 Helpful Content Update (HCU) was clear:

*Do not expect a recovery anytime soon. Some of you may recover during upcoming updates but there’s no guarantee. If you depend on Google, move on and try to find another traffic source.*

Here are key takeaways from Morgan McBride, who attended the event:

* **Recovery is uncertain:** Those affected by the HCU should not expect immediate improvement. Google hinted that a new update is coming “very soon,” but emphasized that recovery may not come with this update, the next, or even the one after that.
* **Diversify traffic sources:** For those heavily dependent on Google, the recommendation was to consider other strategies. Google’s saying that some of us may recover eventually, but not all, and there’s no timeline.

Joshua Tyler offered a more critical perspective, noting that questions from affected “victim” publishers went largely unanswered, with Google representatives consciously ignoring and even gaslighting them. Basically, Google was just gathering feedback on what they need without providing sufficient guidance or reassurance.

Summing up the event, Tyler referred to it as “Google’s funeral”.

***Features***

* **(official) Sitelinks Search Box Going Away This Month**

Google has announced the removal of the Sitelinks Search Box due to decreased usage. 

Starting on November 21, 2024, this feature will gradually be removed from search across all geographies and languages. Note that this change only affects the search box—the standard sitelinks will remain available.

* **(test) Google Generative AI Snippets Across Search**

Google is testing a new AI-generated feature that resembles the ""People Also Ask"" section but instead of questions, it displays subtopics and highlights related to the search query. 

This AI-powered feature offers users a broader view of relevant information on the topic.

* **(test) People’s Insights For Medical Queries**

Google has expanded its “People’s Insights” feature (which is similar to “Discussions and Forums”) to include insights on medical queries, which were previously largely avoided.

To address any concerns relating to this, Google has put up a disclaimer: *“This is for informational purposes only. For medical advice or diagnosis, consult a professional.""*

Users can ask specific questions, and instead of waiting for business owners to reply, they’ll receive instant answers generated by Google’s AI.

* **Google Tests New “Local Places &amp; Compare Sites” Interface**

Google is testing a new ""all places"" and ""compare now"" interface to see businesses and third-party comparison sites outside of Google Search. 

This is something Google launched in the European regions but now some are seeing this in the US with this new user interface.

***Tidbits***

* **Google Achieves Record Ad Revenue in Q3 2024**

In its Q3 2024 earnings report announced last night, Google/Alphabet said that it has seen a 10% increase in ad revenue, reaching $65.85 billion—its highest ad revenue quarter to date. Total revenue rose by 15% to $88.3 billion, with profits up 33%, totaling $26.3 billion. Search revenue alone increased 12% to $49.39 billion.

* **Google Team Updates**

The **Gemini app team** is now part of Google DeepMind, which aims to accelerate the deployment of new models in the app, streamline post-training processes, and leverage the product's momentum.

The **Assistant teams** working on devices and home experiences have shifted to the Platforms &amp; Devices division, aligning them more closely with product surfaces and centralizing AI-driven home initiatives for enhanced user experience.

And on some leadership changes:

Nick Fox has been appointed as the new *Senior Vice President of Knowledge &amp; Information* (K&amp;I), overseeing Search, Ads, Geo, and Commerce products. Prabhakar Raghavan, the former SVP of K&amp;I, is now *Google’s Chief Technologist*.

In the meantime,

* **OpenAI Launches Web Search in ChatGPT**

Now available on web, mobile, and desktop apps. Initially, this feature is accessible to ChatGPT Plus and Team users, as well as those on the SearchGPT waitlist, with broader availability expected in the coming months.

The search model is an enhanced version of GPT-4o, refined with updated data generation techniques and insights from SearchGPT feedback, along with partner data. 

ChatGPT can automatically decide to search the web based on user queries, or users can manually initiate a search using the web search icon. For topics such as weather, stocks, sports, news, and maps, OpenAI has partnered with several major news and data providers to ensure up-to-date information and provide new visual designs.

Current partners include Associated Press, Axel Springer, Condé Nast, Dotdash Meredith, Financial Times, GEDI, Hearst, Le Monde, News Corp, Prisa (El País), Reuters, The Atlantic, Time, and Vox Media. Publishers interested in joining can reach out to explore partnership opportunities.

My 8 Years of Hard Work Devalued Overnight by Google,"I worked hard day and night to stabilize my blog and was earning around $5000 per month, but in September, the HCU and March Core update completely wiped my site from Google search. When I posted on the Search Community, some folks advised that it had poor design and low-quality content. When I asked them which content was an example of low-quality content, they replied, ""Find yourself and learn from it.""

This is a conspiracy theory against small bloggers. My eight years of hard work was devalued overnight without any reason.

Google lacks accountability and transparency. There is no future in blogging. Google officials have been gaslighting small publishers and emphasizing creating helpful content. In reality, Google does not know what is helpful; if it did, many spam and duplicate sites, sites with redirections, and irrelevant results for search queries would stop ranking.

I pay 12 000$ per year for 6 backlinks. How do I know it's worth it ?,"There's a banner with my logo on it and a link to my homepage. This banner can be found on 6 websites (all belonging to the same guy) and I pay 12 000€ per year for that (I know for a fact those banners don't bring any traffic to my website, they're only for backlinks).

I wanted to stop because I find it very expensive but the guy tells me it will badly hurt my seo. 

My seo isn't great at the moment but I'm starting to seriously work on it (technical optimization and content) and I wouldn't want to hurt my seo by cutting important backlinks now.

How Gtranslate Plugin Killed our 2M website,"Hello, it's me, i am back. A lot of you asked what was the plugin used to make my website multilingual, it's Gtranslate. Here how it destroyed us and why you should NEVER install it.

I decided to come here and warn all of you after my website is officially dead and we are pulling the kill switch, and go for bankruptcy or transfer the ownership. Going from 2 million pageviews (3.3M in july btw) to now less than 100k. 

Quick Recap. I have a niche website, for 6 years we were doing very well, over 10s of thousands keywords, over 4000 SERP, ranking 1-3 for 1000 keywords, rank 3 to 10 for 2500 keywords etc. 

We decided to go multilingual and without doing much research we installed Gtranslate. Here how things went wrong. And before going into it. I would like to thank everybody who helped me when i first wrote about this and showed us all the spam that Gtranslate was doing to our SEO. 

First, we have around 20k articles, after Gtranslate, we ended up with 7MILLION links injected and resulted in Millions of errors in our search console. Bam Google flags us as a spam. Never happened ever. Even though we are a niche website we are established and have a lot of expertise about what we write about.

On bi-weekly basis, we were seeing Gtranslate indexing almost 1 million link injected into Search console. Links that don't exist or are not indexable in the main website. including code pages, admin pages etc. Then they did not properly tagged the languages, making english rank for spanish and chinese rank for french etc, so our bounce rate went through the roof. 

No hreflang if you opt for translated slug and no canonical if you opt for none-translated slug. But at on google both slugs can be found on top of origin page that has nothing to do with the canonical, creating millions of duplicated content. 

Their server is very unstable as well, our crawling fail rate went from 0 to 25%. 5xx errors, impossible to access erros, 4xx errors. It just flashing red everywhere.

Here comes google, not only it deranked us, but totally removed us from Discover and limited our Google news traffic.

After talking to their support, they just kept gaslighting us that everything is fine, all errors is us, and about the seo experts, that gave us all the audits about their unstable plugin, they said that these these experts don't know what they are talking about. We kept asking them to come to a solution and get things fix but they refuse to accept their spammy plugin. So we decided to pull the kill switch.

Don't do our mistake. Do not translate Gtranslate plugin unless you want to kiss goodbye to your website. 

I have put screenshot of our dead traffic in comment section.

5 SEO tips I wish I had known earlier,"**1/ Site speed optimization in 90% of cases isn’t the 1st priority**

Website speed in ranking works as a filter. You may be denied the best positions due to poor speed, but you will not be given good positions just for good speed.

Website speed cannot compensate for the quality of content and links.

**2/ Don't try to change people's behavior or Google**

If users enter completely different queries looking for the same product and Google ranks different pages in SERP - create separate pages.

**3/ When comparing search performance across periods, try to ensure that each period has the same number of weekends and weekdays**

Most businesses have big differences in traffic on weekdays and weekends. Without taking this into account, you may think that in some periods your traffic dropped or increased, although this is not the case.

**4/ Your biggest SEO mistakes will come not from inaction, but from unnecessary actions that will not produce results**

Most often this concerns the creation of pages that have too low traffic potential or conversion potential.

**5/ The pain of loss is greater than the joy of gain**

At some point, you should invest more and more in insuring your site against errors that can kill your existing traffic, and not just in increasing traffic.

Unmasking Google: The Rigged System That Favors Giants Over Genuine Content,"Let’s be absolutely clear about what’s happening with Google’s so-called ranking fairness. It’s a travesty—a farce that has been meticulously crafted to deceive anyone trying to compete on a fair playing field. Everyone has been grappling with the aftermath of the September HCU update, and guess what? Not a single soul has recovered. Why, you ask? Because Google has tailored its system to systematically exclude the little guy.

Here’s the brutal truth: You won’t find your site on page one of SERPs unless you are:
- A universally recognized brand or celebrity
- A large corporation
- A certified expert in your field
- A well-established independent brand
- An official government or accredited organization

Why hasn't any site recovered, you wonder? Because the notion that some regular person, running a well-crafted blog, could elevate to the ranks of a corporate giant within half a year is laughable in Google's rigged game.

The real kicker is that Google has concocted these artificial ranking barriers while preaching the opposite—that a passionate individual can create insightful content that ranks. This is a blatant lie. Google dismisses any site that isn't a major brand or corporation, deceiving everyone for years, blaming site owners whenever their flawed system is questioned. They think we're fools, deflecting every critique back at us, trying to gaslight the entire web community.

Let’s dissect their tactics rationally. Google has concocted an enigmatic set of ranking factors they never disclose. It’s a shadow play, where they leave us guessing and stumbling in the dark, misguided and misled, so no one can truly understand why their site ranking plummeted overnight.

Challenge their system? Ask why traffic nosedived despite quality content? You’ll get patronizing questions about recent changes, ad optimization, and affiliate links. It’s a relentless merry-go-round of generic responses designed to sow doubt and make you tweak everything but the actual problem.

Google holds all the cards, never accountable for axing sites from decent rankings. It’s become glaringly evident: if you’re not a behemoth in the corporate world, forget about ranking. Prove your expertise all you want; it won’t matter unless you’re playing the game by their opaque rules.

The entire ranking system is a fix, a deceit where Google maintains the illusion that compliance with their guidelines might lead to recovery—a blatant falsehood since as far back as May 2022.

Consider the absurdity for a moment: a woman with a WordPress site on sewing machines has to jump through ludicrous hoops. She must own and review every model, flaunt credentials in mechanical engineering or textile manufacturing, and, ludicrously, start manufacturing her own machines and create a storefront on her site—only then might Google deign to recognize her as legitimate.

And even then, unless people start searching for her brand by name, recognizing her as a genuine entity, she won’t rank above a blip. She'll remain overshadowed by the likes of CNN or The New York Times, simply because they’re established names with domain authority.

You know what never factors into Google’s SERPs? The actual insightfulness or utility of an article. Google can’t differentiate an exceptional article from mediocre fluff. They’ve opted for a facade of algorithmic evaluation based on external, often irrelevant factors because they cannot genuinely assess content quality.

Let’s lay this out plainly. Google’s inability to recognize the merit of well-written content has led them to depend on superficial metrics—backlinks, schema, site longevity, expert status—all smoke and mirrors.

Why do these external metrics even matter if Google were truly capable of evaluating content on its own? It’s a fundamental flaw in their system, obscured by layers of obfuscation and deceit.

Wake up to the reality. Google’s ranking process is not a measure of quality but a game of influence and visibility, masked by technological sleight of hand. It’s high time we see Google for the charlatan behind the curtain, manipulating perceptions while offering nothing of substance in return for genuine quality.",0.79,93,156,r/SEO,2024-04-29T21:51:16.000Z,post,Rant,t3_1cgblax,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cgblax/unmasking_google_the_rigged_system_that_favors/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cgblax/unmasking_google_the_rigged_system_that_favors/,t2_27v2xetk,CuriousGio,"The post discusses the alleged bias in Google's search engine algorithm that seems to favor large corporations over smaller content creators.

Desperate! - How can my small agency compete without a €3000/month budget?,"I run a small creative agency with my wife. We specialize in 3D animation, illustrations, and especially explainer videos. ([www.jillipp.com](http://www.jillipp.com))

We launched a new website earlier this year, but we’re barely visible on Google. I reached out to an SEO agency here in Austria, but they’re asking for €3000 per month, which is just not feasible for us. I have a 9-month-old daughter, and every euro counts.

So, over the past few months, I've tried to teach myself a bit about SEO.

* Start a blog with posts like: explainer video tool comparisons, selling footage on stock sites, AI tools, etc.
* Try to get featured in newspapers (for backlinks)
* Create social media posts
* Buy ""white hat backlinks"" on Fiverr
* Ask clients to leave Google reviews

I'm not sure it 100% confirms or denies some of these theories - like sandboxing but its an interesting read.Its definitely going to spark a lot of conversations and SEO chatter

&gt;THE API DOCS REVEAL SOME NOTABLE GOOGLE LIES

&gt;Google spokespeople have gone out their way to misdirect and mislead us on a variety of aspects of how their systems operate in an effort to control how we behave as SEOs. I won’t go as far as calling it “social engineering” because of the loaded history of that term. Let’s instead go with… “gaslighting.” Google’s public statements probably aren’t intentional efforts to lie, but rather to deceive potential spammers (and many legitimate SEOs as well) to throw us off the scent of how to impact search results.

&gt;Below, I present assertions from Google employees alongside facts from the documentation with limited commentary so you can judge for yourself.

&gt;“WE DON’T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE DOMAIN AUTHORITY”

&gt;Google spokespeople have said numerous times that they don’t use “domain authority.” I’ve always assumed that this was a lie by omission and obfuscation. 

&gt;By saying they don’t use domain authority, they could be saying they specifically don’t use Moz’s metric called “Domain Authority” (obviously 🙄). They could also be saying they don’t measure the authority or importance for a specific subject matter (or domain) as it relates to a website. This confusion-by-way-of-semantics allows them to never directly answer the question as to whether they calculate or use sitewide authority metrics.

Long Click definitely supports and repudiates the CTR scoring but there's also a lot of reading between the lines - be interesting to see how far and wide the interpretations go.

How much to get to 150k visitors a month?,"Curious, if you wanted to hire a ""standard"" agency (so not a super high priced one and not a cheap fiverr freelancers) and you told them that you want to get to 150k monthly visitors in 18 months, how much would you expect to pay or charge (if you're an agency) per month.

Edit: For people who come in now, not sure who said guarantee but I do not use that word. This is just a broad question, I used this for another reply...

&gt;So, let's look at it again. Get a website in a capable niche (meaning, there is plenty of broad traffic and niche traffic so 150k monthly visitors is entirely possible), we'll call it a new site and domain so no backlinks or authority, 18 month timeline (give or take) to reach roughly 150k monthly visitors.

Also, you would NEVER hire an agency and not set a goal. You would not give them $5-10k or more a month and they tell you ""yea, you might get results, you might not, we'll see what happens"" (If this is what you SEO ""pros"" do, you're shady as fuck). You would have some sort of goal or expectation, and we'll assume no guarantee at the end, but it's what you're aiming for.",0.87,86,104,r/SEO,2024-11-28T00:51:07.000Z,post,,t3_1h1ju1p,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1h1ju1p/how_much_to_get_to_150k_visitors_a_month/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1h1ju1p/how_much_to_get_to_150k_visitors_a_month/,t2_nky4o38,oddball09,The Reddit post is a query from a user seeking information on the cost involved in driving 150k visitors to a website per month.

How Adding TL;DR Boosted My Conversions by 33%,"I recently tried something simple that gave me a **33% increase in conversions**. I added a **TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)** summary to articles and product pages of a client sites. It was a quick change, but it made a big difference. Here’s how I did it and why it worked.

# What I Did: Added TL;DR to Pages

I made two changes:

* **For articles**: I added a short 2-3 sentence summary at the top, giving the main points right away.
* **For product pages**: I wrote a quick summary of the product’s features and benefits, placed right under the title.

The goal was to let visitors quickly see what the page was about without having to scroll through everything. I tested this for about **two weeks**.

# The Results: A 33% Increase in Conversions

After the test, I saw a **33% increase in conversions** across both articles and product pages. Here’s why I think it worked:

1. **Faster Decisions** People didn’t have to read everything. They could see the important points right away and decide if they wanted to stay. This helped them make decisions faster and led to more conversions.
2. **Less Confusion** The TL;DR gave users a quick overview, which helped them understand the page right away. This reduced confusion and made it easier for them to take action.
3. **Better User Experience** The TL;DR made it easier to **scan** the page. Visitors didn’t have to hunt for the main info—they could find it instantly. This kept them on the page longer and increased conversions.

# Why It Worked: The Power of TL;DR

TL;DR worked because it let people **quickly understand** the content. When users can make fast decisions, they are more likely to act. Adding TL;DR is a simple way to improve the **user experience** and increase conversions.",0.96,85,38,r/SEO,2024-12-01T00:35:49.000Z,post,,t3_1h3qstq,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1h3qstq/how_adding_tldr_boosted_my_conversions_by_33/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1h3qstq/how_adding_tldr_boosted_my_conversions_by_33/,t2_2eczpoqs,willkode,"The Reddit post discusses the author's experience with adding a ""TL;DR"" (Too Long; Didn't Read) section to their content and how it resulted in a 33% increase in conversions.

EDIT: a lot of you are offended by what I said... I'm not saying SEO is not important, but the experience I had, plus what I read hear weekly as of recent, makes it HARDER as a business owner to invest in to SEO

Ultimately, YOU'RE product is competing for my digital marketing dollars against FB ads &amp; google ads which in my brain is simple... money + good converting offer = leads and from there I can scale and see direct ROI

SEO, unfortunately in my mind, has become this elusive industry controlled by evil google, and if YOU'RE not confident as the expert, how do you expect me to have confidence?",0.82,76,152,r/SEO,2024-05-18T02:19:11.000Z,post,,t3_1cumst3,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cumst3/as_a_small_business_owner_seeing_all_your/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cumst3/as_a_small_business_owner_seeing_all_your/,t2_jukgrkt,vchak8,The Reddit post is from a small business owner who has been discouraged by the negative posts about a recent update in SEO.

"Reached $6.46 yesterday! Highest so far, started in April","I think someone shared one of my sites yesterday and had heaps of new traffic,

***TUE, SEP 17, 2024*** 

**Estimated earnings - $6.57**

**Page views - 2,476**

**Page RPM - $2.65**

**Impressions - 2,729**

I know this isn't in the hundreds of dollars, but it's still the highest I've seen thus far.

I'm still building my sites and working on social etc. but just sharing some insights, very simply.

Make something you can passively manage.

I think a lot of people want to make passive income whilst spending all their time trying, but that's not passive.. that's underpaid work.

Find a rhythm and get to the point where you're doing so many other things (or doing nothing at all, if you are okay with sitting in thought) that you on the daily forget that you have sites that are serving ads, that's the best.

My average a day is $3-5, I use adsense.

My next goal is to reach $10 a day, and then hopefully $100 a day since these sites are still very fresh, hopefully time will prove helpful.

I'm open to advice on all front. Or questions, though I'm well aware I have much to learn since I barely cross $100 a month for the payout!

None-the-less, I'm very proud of this, and excited to keep working on my portoflio!

I'm not really sure what a good RPM is, I saw someone in finance had upwards of $60\~ crazy

Would love to know what your stats are,

Thanks and I hope to post again soon with better results!

Am I over paying for SEO work?,"I have had some bad experiences in the past, paying for SEO services when my business was really just getting bamboozled.

I am trying my hand with a new agency. For context, I own a vacation rental company in a large market. We currently spend roughly $2,200 a month with an agency that specializes in our industry.

I am not an seo expert, but am somewhat competent enough in the subject to hold a conversation about it, ask some meaningful questions, I have a semrush account if that means anything..

This agency is supposed to produce a certain amount of meaningful content a month, as well as some technical work on the backend, and outreach for meaningful backlinks in my area/space. My initial content I received back from them was absolute dogshit. It would’ve been bad if I was paying someone off Fiverr $100 a month, but for $2200 it was completely unacceptable. I have them reproducing that, and hopefully the content will improve.

Because of past experience, I’m worried my business will just light another 25k on fire this year with this agency. (They are also doing ppc starting next month, not sure if this is relevant).

My take away from the Google algorithm leak ,"Here are some of my key takeaways from the leak:

As expected, Google spokespeople have been lying about some elements of the ranking algorithm - like Google not using a site authority score


Links do matter for ranking, but they need to be tier 1 links with varied anchor text

Google has a small publisher classifier - which may mean they're specifically targeting blogs in updates

EEAT isn't real, except for author authority

Topical authority/nicheing down is a ranking factor tied to a ""siteFocusScore""

The Man Who Killed Google [Steve Jobs on Why Monopolies Die],"Some very interesting insights coming out as to why the SERPs are providing low-quality search results at the moment on Google, which is coming from internal issues/politics at Google:

&gt;  
In February 2019, Google's ads and finance teams called a ""code yellow"" on search, because revenue was slow and - seriously - people were not asking Google enough questions. Ben Gomes, then head of search, refused to make Google Search worse for profit— Ed Zitron (@edzitron) April 23, 2024  

Gomes managed to help get Google through the code yellow - but Raghavan demanded more, saying Ben hadn't increased queries enough. Gomes sent a letter to stating he was ""deeply, deeply uncomfortable"" with the ways that Google wanted to grow search— Ed Zitron (@edzitron) April 23, 2024  

Prabhakar Raghavan may be a computer scientist, but he joined Google in 2012 as a manager, working directly under CEO Sundar Pichai, a former McKinsey man. Raghavan is a class traitor that deliberately ran out Ben Gomes, who worked on search for 19 years.— Ed Zitron (@edzitron) April 23, 2024

Prabhakar Raghavan is a career failure, a man who has fallen upwards into the most important job in software, and since becoming head of search in 2020, Google has become an ultra-profitable and increasingly less-useful site. Raghavan is a villain. — Ed Zitron (@edzitron) April 23, 2024  


  
Google replaced a founding member who was passionate about user experience for a guy who worked at Yahoo and caused Yahoo to make considerable losses financially, this explains perfectly why Google is a complete mess at the moment

This is a classic example of exactly what Steve Jobs said was the reason why monopolist companies die:  


&gt;  
When you have monopoly market share, the company's not any more successful. So the people that can make the company more successful are sales and marketing people, and they end up running the companies. And the product people get driven out of the decision making forums, and the companies forget what it means to make great products. The product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies that have no conception of a good product versus a bad product. They have no conception of the craftsmanship that's required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. And they really have no feeling in their hearts, usually, about wanting to really help the customers – Steve Jobs

Link Building Guide 101 How to find sites and build backlinks. ,"I have seen countless posts asking about link building. So, considering those, I thought to share some strategies I use for my sites and client sites. 

These strategies apply to any niche. I have used Ahrefs for most of these tasks. Feel free to use any other tool. 

Before starting, you need to understand what backlinks do, what kinds of links you should get, the relevancy of a link, anchor texts, page rank, authority and other basic stuff so you don’t just randomly build as many links as possible and burn a lot of your budget. For this, I can make a separate post explaining these. 

# Method #1.0 Competitors Backlink Profile

This is a common practice. You can do domain-level or page-level analysis of your competitor's backlinks profile 

\&gt; Go to Semrush, Ahrefs, Mangools, or any other similar tool

\&gt; Add your competitor site in the domain overview/site explorer

\&gt; Go to referring domains 

\&gt; Filtering and Analyzing Referring Domains:

**DR (Domain Rating) Filter:**

* Set a DR range typically between 10-60
* This ensures you're targeting sites with some authority but not ultra-competitive domains
* Although DR doesn’t really matter and can be increased without much effort with no positive or negative impact on rankings this helps a lot of the time in filtering out spam and fresh sites.

**Traffic Filters**

* Minimum organic traffic: 100-500 monthly visitors
* This ensures the site has real traffic and isn't just a placeholder or low-quality domain

**Relevance Filters**

* Use the ""Domain Categorization"" or ""Referring Domains"" section
* Look for sites in similar or related industries
* Check site categories and topical relevance to your niche

**Link Quality Checks**

# Method #1.1 Analyzing Competitor's Backlink profile using Bing Webmaster tools 

A big thanks to u/weblinkr for suggesting this a while back. You can get all the backlinks pointing to a domain by using the Bing webmaster tool. All you need to do is go to Bing webmaster tool &gt; Backlinks &gt; Backlinks to any site &gt; add a competitor/s website&gt; Analyze backlinks side by side or sites individually. 

You can see all the referring domains and Anchor texts they are using. Plain and simple. 

Side note: Add your site to Bing Webmaster and add their index now plugin/app to your site. Helps with getting references from SearchGpt. 

# Method #1.2 Using Ahrefs Link Intersect Tool 

* Enter your Website URL into Site Explorer in Ahrefs 
* Go to the Link Intersect report
* Enter a few competitors’ homepages in blank fields
* Set the search mode for all pages to “URL”
* You will see a button “Show link opportunities” Click on it. 

This method will show you all the websites linking to one or more of your competitors’ homepages and not to yours. If you find such sites, there is a high chance you can place your links on these sites as well.

# Method #2 Find sites using Content Explorer in Ahrefs for guest posts and link insertions. 

This one is pretty simple. 

\&gt; Go to ahrefs&gt; Content explorer &gt; Add your keyword

You will see thousands of sites that have that particular keyword on their page which means most of these sites are relevant to you (you will see competitors in the list too). 

For guest post/niche edits opportunities you can filter out sites, authors and so much more. 

You can also filter out sites for Link insertion and also find out listicle articles that mention 1 or more of your competitors where you can add your site as well. To do this in content explorer search for “Comp 1” “Comp 2” “Comp 3” “your business”

This will show you all the mentions. Reach out to the editor or webmaster and get yourself a mention too (with a link). 

# Method # 3 Use HARO (Connectively) or similar sites

Journalists at times look for answers and they post on sites like these. You can answer their queries with your expertise and if they use the provided info useful, they will cite your site. 



# Method # 4 Use Search Operators 

site:: Searches within a specific domain type or website

intitle:: Finds pages with specific words in the title

inurl:: Locates pages with keywords in the URL

""keyword"": Helps with exact phrase matching

\-site:: Excludes specific websites from search results

""submit a link"": Discovers sites accepting external link submissions

""write for us"": Finds guest posting opportunities

**Here are all the search operators:** 

* intitle:""resource list"" + keyword
* intitle:""recommended websites"" + keyword
* ""submit a link"" + keyword
* ""add your site"" + keyword

**Niche-specific operators:**

* inurl:links + ""your industry""
* intitle:directory + keyword
* ""guest post"" + keyword
* ""write for us"" + keyword

# How to secure deals and build relationships. 

After finding a site to outreach to. You can offer them: 

\&gt; An article they can publish with your links in it ( you can copy their sitemap and ask ChatGPT for content gaps that they haven’t written on and offer topics you can write a free article about). 

\&gt; You can offer them money in exchange for links. You can negotiate and finalise the price. 

\&gt; Offer Link exchange. Once you have some sites that you know either have a price or ask for an article, keep them and offer new owners these sites as a link exchange opportunity. 



I tried to simplify all these methods. Hope this helps.

Is it possible to go from 45k to 120k in monthly traffic in 2-3 months?,"Hi All,

I work at a small firm where I am the sole marketer. This is not how it was supposed to be but since the marketing director left, I have had to shoulder the responsibility for everything - from email marketing, sales enablement, video editing, social media and graphic design to SEO. I was initially hired as the product marketing manager.

I don't know much about seo but last week when we noticed one of our new competitor’s (new as in new to our industry; they were earlier in an adjacent industry) traffic jumped from 10k to 150k in August, I have been tasked to triple our website's traffic and double the leads coming through it in the next 2-3 months. I am here looking for some advice.

Currently, our website has ~45k total users in a month with about 3k backlinks. We get about 120 qualified leads from the website in a month.

I am learning my way through seo. I have learnt quite a bit from this sub. So thanks to all the folks here. But I am fairly new to it and I know my knowledge is lacking.

Right now I am thinking along the following lines but I have certain queries. I would be grateful if I could get your thoughts on these queries that I have:

1) I plan to focus on acquiring high quality backlinks from topically relevant websites (belonging to the same or similar niche as our company) through guest posts, link exchanges etc. I was also thinking of tapping into PBNs for this - thinking of purchasing aged domains on different hosting providers, spruce them up a bit, and link from only one domain per hosting provider to our website. 

I am not focusing too much on DA as a metric but on the relevance of the referring domain, its traffic and its own tier 1,2 and 3 backlink profile. From what I know the referring domains shouldn't have had any penalties and itself have a niche relevant backlink profile.

*Question:* Should I go for link purchases instead for some short term benefits, given my deadline? It seems to me that our competitor bought a huge amount of backlinks. The number of their total backlinks jumped by ~2000 in January and then again by 400 in July. Then in August, their traffic jumped from 10k per month to 150k per month (as mentioned above). This dropped to 110k in September. I also checked a few links in their backlink profile. Seems like spammy websites with tons of comments from people just describing their companies and leaving a link to their website. There were some other links showing ""this page doesn't exist anymore"" message too. However, this was also coupled with a content strategy focusing on targeting high traffic and high difficulty business relevant keywords. They have been able to successfully secure top ranks on such keywords since their traffic went up significantly. I think it's because of the bulk backlink acquisition. But I may be wrong. Could there be any other reason behind this traffic jump? There have been no other changes to their website from what I glean.

2) We do currently rank at the top for quite a few business relevant, high traffic and high difficulty keywords. I was thinking of doubling down on such keywords more. However, instead of just targeting keywords and stuffing content with it, which from what I have learnt is passé, I will be instead focusing actually building topical authority, i.e. writing content in a format that matches the search intent while ensuring improved content depth and breadth, targeting the right topic clusters with the right keywords, and making sure everything is properly linked using a tool such as link whisperer. I will also try to not over-optimise the content.

*Question*: is my outlook on this correct? Or am i missing anything here? Is there any other way I should approach this?

3) I also checked our website's score on pagespeed. For desktop, it's around 75 and for mobile it's around 45, which I know is abysmal. I will be working with a Webdev on improving this so that for both the score is between 80-100. Schema markup is another thing that I'll look into.

*Question*: when it comes to technical seo, what else do websites generally focus on that can help with better rankings?

4) I have informed the management that 2-3 months is quite a short timeline. Proposed what seemed to me a more realistic timeline: 5-6 months. 

*Question:* Was i correct in doing this? Is 5-6 months a realistic timeline? How do you usually convince management of what's a realistic goal to chase, especially in a situation where the competition has zoomed past you, sending everyone into a frenzy?

I would really, really appreciate your thoughts on my queries. Like I said, I am still learning seo. My knowledge of it may be faulty. But I am sincerely willing to learn more. Any thoughts or advice would mean a lot.

People ask a lot about getting backlinks here,"People are asking quite often how to get backlinks here. Since I've typed a couple of replies with the same answers, maybe this post can help.

**First thing:** I would always recommend starting by checking what links are pointing to your competitors. Chances are you'll find many good sites that allow guest posts and let you include one or two backlinks there.

But that's not it.

When you find some good blogs, you don't want to add some content and links and submit the article.

A lot of people do it this way; they write some average content and only add links to their own websites.

The problem is: natural content always contains outgoing links to multiple relevant sites. You'll feed Google's spam-detecting algorithm if you're not adding links naturally, so link to other relevant sites as well. It will boost the quality of the page and the links on them.

**So, how to find sites to get links from again:**

* Use any tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, or Rankfast to see what sites are linking to your competitor. Those sites are your targets. Most of the time, it's pretty clear how to get those links as well.
* Set the filter to ""Dofollow.""
* Add filter type: ""Article"" or ""In content""
* Now you see a lot of valuable backlinks, you should target yourself.

**Remember: this is not the only way to get backlinks**

Other great backlinks can come from placements on platforms, where you can (almost always) submit your site for free and get decent backlinks from them:

* indiepage
* Uneed
* ProductHunt
* 1000 tools
* BetaList

**Finally, you get backlinks by buying them from good vendors.**

I'm afraid a lot of SEOs don't like to share those vendors because, well, they're selling those links to clients too.

However, what you need to look out for is shady backlink sellers. It's a business where a lot of crap is sold.

Make sure the links you buy have good Domain Scores (DA/DR, whatever) but also check if the site has decent traffic.

Links from sites with strong domain scores but zero traffic are sold for high prices, but they are close to worthless.

Not going to complain, just thought it would be fun to share my biggest website fall from fame.

This was a side project of mine of a company catalog, displaying all available public infomation about other companies.

I might try to ressurect the seo for the website, but i've been too busy developing other websites that actually makes money.

Edit: since people are asking, i thought i could add more context.

The website displays all public info of all companies in Scandinavia, i wanted it because the other platforms displaying the info i was looking for, was really really slow, and had stale info. And at that same time, i wanted to learn more about building network protocols with go and rust, so just sat down one weekend and made this website.

Made a database of all the companies, ran a cronjob to update all info every 2 hours, and made it public.

Added a sitemap of all this on google search console, and then the traffic exploded from day 1.

That's kinda all there is to it. Never did anything other than making a pretty, and performant website with a max load time of 0,2 seconds. Pagespeed insights scores all tested url's at 100/100/100/100.

I realized that a major part of the guest post pricing goes towards the commissions that agents take. (I’m not against agents; in fact, I believe this tool is mainly for agents.) I needed a way to find and approach these websites directly and bypass the agents (sorry...).

So, as a veteran programmer, I created an AI-based tool to find the websites that accept guest posts based on categories and keywords, identify the contact person for these sites (often the owner), determine the real traffic of these sites, and also assess the Domain Authority (DA) (although I never paid too much attention to DA). The most important parameter for me is traffic, especially search engine traffic.

To date, my private tool has discovered over 10,000 such sites, and it continues to discover between 50-100 more every week.

**Traffic breakdown**

\~10% - traffic &gt; 100,000 visitors/month  
\~45% - traffic &gt; 10,000 visitors/month

If you care about **DA,** here is the **breakdown**

\~2% DA &gt; 80  
\~6% DA &gt; 60  
\~20% DA &gt; 50  
\~35% DA &gt; 40  
\~45% DA &gt; 30

Unlike other sites and tools, this is not another intermediary that charges for posting your content or charges by submission. It gives you access to the **constantly updated** list of sites, for a fixed monthly or yearly subscription. Then you can then post to these sites directly. Most of them (even big ones) accept posts for free, and if they do charge for posting, no commission will be added to their price.

**Summary of benefits**

- Save 70-100% of guest post pricing by skipping middleman fees.

- No more pay-per-post. Fixed pricing grants you access to the entire updated list.

- Access tens of thousands of news, blogs, and other websites from over 100 categories that accept guest posts directly.

- The list is updated weekly with new sites.

**My questions**

1. Is this a tool you’d be interested in?

2. What subscription would you expect to pay? (please be honest, remember, you’ll get it for free as a thank-you for your help)

- Around $19.90/month  
- Around $39.90/month  
- Around $67/month  
- Higher...

3. How do you describe yourself?

- SEO agency - doing SEO for others.  
- Website(s) owner - doing SEO for myself.  
- Other - please specify.

4. Anything else you’d like to share?

5. Do you agree I can contact you for additional questions?

Backlinks Are Vital For Google,"Really tired of seeing the utter misinformation in the sub regarding link building. 

Link building is still a vital tool for ranking difficult terms at the top of Google. I've seen multiple pages go to number one over the last 12 months by virtue of link building. Being at number one for a commercial term is still lucrative - even if its been pushed down slightly.

  
The problem here is that the majority of people don't do it right. Agencies too. They acquire bad links, or a bad overall profile and complain when it doesn't work.

  
Links need to be varied - a mixture of site types that all pertain to the same niche (meaning you can't just procure links on news websites and expect them to work - this stopped working in like 2015). 

  
The sites need to receive traffic in the main from where you're doing business, it needs to rank for keywords relating to its niche, it needs to not be a complete spam shop.

  
Traffic matters - is there engagement? However, these days, I'd prefer a link from a small website that ranks for pertinent related terms, than a massive news site that ranks for anything and everything - Google pays attention to this. Say you're trying to rank for a Childs clothing store - I'd rather a link on a mom blog that talks about kids fashion etc., and ranks for clothing terms with like 2k traffic, than a massive news site. 

  
It's all about creating a believable link profile. Its what almost everyone does wrong then spreads misinformation. It's incredibly logical and obvious - its very time consuming as the content needs to be on ponit and you need to put time into finding good sites. 

  
Do it right, and you'll climb for even the hardest keywords. Do it wrong, and nothing will happen. 

It's still one of the most important ranking factors for Google - like I've said - I've seen many commercial terms go to no.1 by doing this right. There's no argument. Do not believe you can get away with not doing this. Learn how to do it properly - or make sure the agency you're using is doing it properly - and stop believing rants on Reddit from people who haven't used the right methodology.

Has Google Lost Control of Its Search Algorithm?,"**Since the September 2023 Helpful Content Update, most small to medium-sized and independent publishers have lost over 90% of their website traffic.**

**Many have shared their stories on X, pointing out that some high-quality websites were unfairly impacted by the algorithm update.**

**Meanwhile, big brands have either maintained or increased their traffic, despite publishing low-quality content. Independent publishers producing excellent content have still experienced a 90% drop in traffic. This pattern suggests a bias in Google’s favor towards larger brands over smaller, independent publishers.**

**During this time, some so-called SEO professionals tried to convince independent publishers that Google was doing a great job and that these websites deserved to be penalized.**

**Then, in March 2024, the Core and Spam Update hit, further reducing traffic by over 98% for many sites.**

**From September 2023 to March 2024, in just six months, most small and independent websites were brought to the brink of extinction, with no recovery from the September 2023 Helpful Content Update.**

**Google's March 2024 search update stated that 40% of low-quality, unoriginal content would be removed from search results. At the same time, they introduced three new policies: Scaled Content Abuse, Expired Domain Abuse, and Site Reputation Abuse.**

**The Site Reputation Abuse policy is set to take effect on May 5, 2024, giving big brands two months to adjust their websites according to Google's spam policies.**

**My question is: why is Google giving big publishers a two-month advance warning, while small and independent publishers are immediately penalized?**

**If Google knows that wiping out 40% of websites and applying further penalties will result in a lack of content for certain queries, it suggests they don’t fully understand how their algorithm works.**

**When May 5 arrives and the Site Reputation Abuse policy is implemented, Google is likely to limit manual actions instead of taking algorithmic action—likely out of fear of penalizing big publishers. Once again, we see clear bias in favor of large brands.**

**Later, people began asking Google Search Liaison, Danny Sullivan, on X when the algorithmic action would be applied. He became frustrated and responded, ""We will announce when it is applied.""**

**In August, Barry Schwartz from Search Engine Roundtable interviewed Google's Search Liaison and asked again why the action wasn’t algorithmic. Sullivan replied, ""The reason we probably won’t have it any time in the near future is that we want to be exceedingly careful and thoughtful in how we do it. So that’s taking time, and for the moment, manual actions are the way to go.""**

**So, my question to Danny is: why is Google being extra careful with algorithmic action for big publishers?**

**When you rolled out the September 2023 Helpful Content Update and the March 2024 Core Update, why weren’t you extra careful when penalizing small and independent, helpful websites?**

**Why is Google always targeting small and independent websites without considering all the parameters?**

**Google rolled out the August 2024 Core Update, and for the first time in nearly 11 months, about 20%-25% of websites saw slight traffic gains compared to pre-2023 levels.**

**However, after the rollout was complete, many publishers reported that those same gains disappeared, leaving their websites wiped out again.**

**My question is: why does this happen? One month, your website is considered helpful, and the next, it’s unhelpful—then it's helpful again, only to be deemed unhelpful once more.**

**It seems like Google's machine learning algorithm is either broken or out of control, and even Google’s engineers don’t know what they’re doing. I don’t think Google truly knows what constitutes helpful content.**

**In conclusion, if Google were to publicly admit it has lost control of its search algorithm, I would make more money shorting Alphabet's stock than blogging. However, I know Google will never admit that something is wrong with their algorithm, even though it's clear something is off.**

**As small publishers, we can never compete with Google because we have limited resources compared to big publishers, which is why Google always prioritizes big publishers over small ones.**",0.84,61,136,r/SEO,2024-10-02T10:40:38.000Z,post,,t3_1fud49v,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1fud49v/has_google_lost_control_of_its_search_algorithm/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1fud49v/has_google_lost_control_of_its_search_algorithm/,t2_bchz81lt,cr77_77,The Reddit post questions whether Google has lost control over its search algorithm.

"Reddit Says It's ""Growth"" Has Nothing To Do With Google (lmfao - big liars)","Executives said the visitor increase was partly due to a boost in traffic from Alphabet’s Google search engine. In response, analysts questioned whether it was somehow related to Reddit’s deal to license its content to Google for training artificial intelligence, and whether such growth would be sustainable in future. 

Reddit management insisted there was no direct link between the content-licensing deal and the platform’s increase in traffic. Instead, they attributed increased Google search traffic to better website performance improving Reddit’s ranking in search results. They also pointed to 27% growth in logged-in users—meaning users who have accounts on the site and therefore are less likely to have arrived via a Google search—as proof of growing engagement.

“The biggest factor driving user growth is the performance and product quality, because that’s what’s driving retention and so retention compounds into growth over time,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said during the earnings call. 

It’s particularly important for Reddit to be able to prove the explosive growth isn’t dependent on a Google algorithm change—because that could be susceptible to being reversed or altered. It’s also clear that Reddit needs more content-licensing deals with AI partners, like the one it struck with Google, to keep growing.

Google's SEO Updates Has Gone Too Far - When Will It End?,"Google's latest SEO spam update has caused a lot of sites drops in traffic, for up to 90% in some cases and even complete removal from the SERP.

This update intended to target spammy and low-quality sites, but unfortunately.. small businesses, content creators, bloggers, and entrepreneurs are being unfairly penalized as well, despite providing high-quality content.

This isn't just about numbers and traffic.. it’s about livelihoods.

Why this matters:

* Lot of revenue loss for small businesses and independent creators.
* High-quality sites are being unfairly affected, which discourage high valuable content creation.
* Lack of transparency make it difficult to adapt to changes.

What we can do:

* Use Reddit, Twitter, and forums to share your story and highlight the real-world impact.
* Engage in other posts related to this matter.
* Explore and support alternatives search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo.
* Raise Awareness to other people
* Provide Feedback to Google using Google’s feedback tools.

The call for a fair Internet:

Let’s demand fairer practices and greater transparency from Google. Join the conversation, share your stories, and let’s push for for a fair Internet where small business and bloggers can thrive.

Am I doing too much? First SEO job. ,"I started my first job seven months ago, initially hired as a Copywriter. Over time, however, I was also tasked with handling SEO.

We have two websites for different product lines, and my responsibilities have grown significantly. Currently, I write around 16 blog posts a month, along with creating social media posts, ads, landing pages, proofreading, and translation. On top of that, I’m expected to address technical issues, even though I'm not always sure what to look for. Most importantly, we’re redesigning our website, and I'm in charge of optimizing it to ensure a successful launch.

While this is my first job, and I genuinely enjoy it, I'm unsure if my workload is typical. Over the past seven months, I've gained a lot of SEO knowledge, though my initial experience was limited to keywords and keyword research.

So far, I've increased blog views by 104% and organic search traffic by 27% over the last four months. My main focus has been regularly publishing high-quality content. 

Since it’s a startup, we’ve never had an SEO specialist before—and this is my first time in such a role. I have a few questions:

1. Is my workload excessive?
2. What does a typical 9-to-5 schedule look like for others in similar roles?
3. Are my metrics good or just average?
4. Can you recommend SEO courses? My biggest challenge is learning everything by myself without guidance or supervision. If there are advanced courses to help me in my role, that would be great.

Unpopular Opinion: Blackhat tactics shouldn't be ignored in your SEO campaigns ,"I know many of you will probably look at the title and think to yourselves what an idiot this guy is using black hat SEO tactics and he's going to get his websites banned or thrown to the shadow realms of Google. Well, I can tell you since I've been doing so for a while now that I haven't received a single penalty from Google and furthermore I haven't received any manual actions or bumps from potential updates that are in place to detect ""Spam"" or black hat-worthy tactics. In fact, I'd say black hat tactics have taken my SEO game to a new level since it provides me with another layer of resources that most people never dare to dip into. Take my GMB for example, I've been running CTR manipulation on each profile using proxies, user timers, and additional security measures to make sure Google doesn't list it as bot traffic and we've improved our rankings for select keywords across the board.

At the end of the day it's your choice and whether it's something small that many people do like buying backlinks or something much larger such as CTR manipulation I don't think they should be ignored especially when you considered the challenges many small businesses face today going up against such large brands that feel almost unbeatable when it comes to SEO having around the clock teams and endless resources.

How SEO killed the internet,"A few days ago, I saw a post here about ""How SEO is killing the internet"". I agree with the title, but I didn't agree with the author's arguments.

I think it's clear that most users, when they search for something, are looking for short and direct answers (except when it's a specialized search). I imagine Google is now prioritizing user experience over any metric.

Google now prefers to rank comments full of abbreviations, grammar mistakes, and typos from a Reddit or Quora post, written in two minutes by someone with a phone, sitting at a bus stop, instead of a specialized niche site with research, images, and more. Why? Because that's what users click on when they search for something. It's very common for users to search for a term and add ""Reddit"" or ""Quora"" at the end because they know they'll find a quick answer there. Most people want fast and direct answers, rather than long and standardized articles.

However, these types of posts were not ranked by Google before, so it wasn't worth creating them. Basically, Google taught the wrong way to please users, aiming to please the algorithm instead. Now they've changed their mind and are discarding all those posts. It started with small and medium blogs... but eventually, it will reach the big ones too.",0.84,56,59,r/SEO,2024-07-18T15:05:10.000Z,post,,t3_1e6doso,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1e6doso/how_seo_killed_the_internet/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1e6doso/how_seo_killed_the_internet/,t2_b5sf302ld,droidlocalweb,"The Reddit post discusses the negative impact of SEO on the internet, arguing that it has led to a decline in the quality of online content.

Black Hat that still works after 2024 March Update with evidence,"I came across this tactic because the company I work for is ranking in the similar set as some of their keywords. Google is pretty good at detecting online gambling sites, so these sites cannot do SEO organically.

They way they do it is, after March 2024 Update, they purchased expired domains (in the tune of 200+ domains) and they set up a headers detection to detect if the requests come from Googlebots, they would show Google the content (which scraped from top results in the keywords they're ranking); however, if the request header is not of Googlebot, they would redirect you to their betting sites.

I follow the trends of many of my competing sites, and it's the same. 80-90% drop in Google traffic.

Even Neil Patel has lost so much traffic that he doesn't bother posting new articles, only sending emails begging for business.

So, is writing and publishing informational articles a waste of time now that AI can answer everything? Or that Google and Bing scrape and copy your knowledge without bothering with a link?

If you have succeeded in taming the HCU, please share details of how you survived and prospered.

But I doubt that many of you have done so.

Bing won't save niche and affiliate bloggers,"So many comments on this sub talk about changing to Bing, or encouraging people to use it instead of Google.

That's because for some bloggers, all they are getting now is Bing and Yahoo traffic. So, pushing people to use Bing is purely out of self-interest rather than offering a logical solution.

And, Bing is not a great search engine. It's UX is cluttered, messy and confusing. A majority of people who use it are Windows users who are too lazy or don't know how to change default search engines.

On top of that, Bing doesn't announce its algorithm changes or offer any advice to site owners, and its webmaster tools is poor compared to GSC.

"SEO experts, does this sound like a good plan? ","Hi everyone, I reached out to an SEO person on Fiverr to see if they could do some SEO work on my website.  My website is in the social service industry and I am looking to rank higher in google to attract more clients.   Does her plan sound legit?  This is what she said: 

Hello, I already checked your Squarespace website, a lot of problems on your site that will affect the google ranking factor.  
  
Firstly, you need to set up on-page SEO properly for your site's good condition. Because your website will be listed in Google after doing a good On-page SEO setup, it will help Google better understand your website. On-page SEO is all inner work of a website, such as keywords research, keyword Setup, Title Optimization, Meta description, image alt text fix, robots.txt generate, Google analytics and webmaster tool set up, google search console verify, sitemap create and submit on google, Link index in google, and all other things. Complete on-page SEO takes 7 to 15 days.  
Complete On page SEO $175.  
  
I’m sorry if this sounds a little technical, but rest assured. These techniques will certainly improve your ranking in the search and organic traffic. On-page optimization is the cornerstone of SEO. Google won't be able to pull meta-data from your website if it isn't properly inserted. Site optimization &amp; fixing technical errors are two of the most significant aspects of On-Page work. However, on-page is more about fixing on-site errors.  
  
You need to start off-page SEO after finishing the on-page SEO. Off-page SEO is an external work of a website, such as Link building, Backlinks, and all other things. You need to run off-page SEO on a monthly basis. And by the way, On-page SEO is one-time work. It takes 7 to 15 days. and on the other hand, off-page is not one-time task, you should run the off-page SEO (link building/Backlinks service) for 6 to 7 months. When I finished on-page SEO, I will give you all details work reports of on-page SEO. And on that work report, I will more details explain about off-page SEO.

Should I Burn Down My Site,"Hi  
  
I know enough to be dangerous about SEO but would never claim to be practitioner.  My issue is ongoing for over 18 months now which simply put is no leads and practically no clicks.  I have had a site for over 15+ years and in the past 2ish years it is dead as a turkey for me.  Perhaps 1-2 leads a quarter.  I fully understand that the SERPS now have Ads/ GMB and so on.  Most of my work these days comes from Fiverr which is just about paying the bills.

For some simple stats my TOTAL clicks in the pst 3 months per GSC is 82 but 90K Impressions.  

I am now of the belief that I might as well not have this site as it isn't generating leads / clicks or engagement.  

To be honest I am seriously thinking after 15+ years in the business (web design) of getting out of it I am 57 years of age and although I am thankful for the above Fiver work it is draining and low budget delivering sites for a price that 5-6 years ago I was delivering organically for 5-6X the same price.

Is our SEO company ripping us off ? Should we switch to a different one? ,"I work as a marketing manager for a roofing company. A SEO agency has been working for us since before I was hired. I dived into our traffic and found some things that didn't feel right. 

1. Big spikes in organic and direct traffic that could not be explained. We did not see a big increase in calls or lead forms. Also this is not reflected in Google Search Console. I know that organic traffic in Google Analytics is not only from Google. This still seems off. In the past three months we have 13k users from organic traffic in GA and in the same period we have had 403 clicks in Google Search console. So .03% of our organic traffic is coming from Google ? That doesn't seem right. 

2. The number of indexed pages we have in GSC is 43. They send us their own report that says we have over 400 pages indexed and getting traffic and clicks. Some of these pages are really odd. We are a roofing company and some of the pages they say are getting traffic have to do with lawyers. Like /divorce law.

  
3. They charge us 5k a month and produce 1 blog post a quarter. They say they have an custom AI that scans our site and competitors sites and edits our existing pages to help us rank better. I asked how we can be ranking for new keywords and indexing new pages with out producing new content, and they said their AI does it for us and producing new content and pages is an ""old school way"" of doing things.

How to find an SEO guy? ,"I recently had the website for my non-profit built through a freelancer on fiver. While it looks like what I asked for, I’m not sure what is under the covers (I’m no developer).

And then how do I find an SEO guy? On fiver, there are many many many highly rated freelancers, but reviews often mention that results are yet to be seen or that small tests in SEO tools showed zero SEO score improvements.

23 years old Ecommerce site &amp; Blog dying slowly,"Our shop, which has been around for 23 years, initially had a single domain dedicated to providing information about our brick&amp;mortar store. Since 2006, we have had a separate domain for our ecommerce operations and the blog, which receives most of our traffic and is regularly updated. The other site is not often updated.

In recent years, we've noticed a significant decline in website visits, exacerbated by recent Google updates that slashed our traffic by almost half each time. We've previously hired SEO teams, but their efforts were of low quality and had minimal impact, though they were fortunately not harmful.

Last December, we engaged a new SEO team who have been performing well, albeit slowly. Despite fixing technical issues and working on enhancing our brand, our visits again dropped significantly in May. We have been trying to connect our brand website with our e-commerce site to signal to Google that they are part of the same entity, but this strategy hasn't yielded the desired results.

It appears that paying for expensive links from newspapers and major websites is the only strategy that moves the needle. Alternatively, we could build our brand on social media and attract customers through those channels. However, given that our project falls under YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) guidelines, we face many restrictions. Competitors often disregard these regulations, posting updates that seem dubious at best, but we are not willing to take such risks.

Some data to understand better this project:

* Core web vitals green at 80%
* No warnings or manual penalties, ever
* Sometimes listed in discover, even 2 months ago, but almost no clicks
* More than 8k pages indexed by google. Most of them related to the ecommerce (around 80%)
* Less than one hundred 404 errors, fixing them often, but takes time to get cleaned from GSC
* Social profiles were active and updating at least 3-5 times a week until 2 months ago, almost no activity so I stopped (the profiles are many years old too)
* Sitemaps correct
* HTTPS correct
* Rich snippets for some parts of the product sheets, recipes in the blog, FAQ, shopper, breadcrumbs, blog and products users reviews and videos
* Some original videos in our youtube channel and vimeo, few of them super good quality, useful, and long, made with an professional agency, almost 0 impact, so I stopped too because every video was $$$
* Almost 2000 links from other websites, some of them highly related, others not. Some of them very high authority, most of them not, but all mixed
* Thousands of online reviews in Google, Ekomi and other sites, 95% 5 stars
* DA 42, TF 30, CF 33

Again, looks that the only way to solve this is pour money in expensive links to get another higher authority sites talk about how good is our brand.

But I wanted to hear you out guys.

I'm open to provide more info, and for the link DM please.

Update:

Some more important points, and answers.

* Old site is almost no updated, just info about the shop.
* Old site is branded, I moved the shop to exact phrase domain when it was working (2006), but turns out that since some years ago it is the opposite. Would be a good strategy to migrate the updated site to be part of the branded site?
* Marketing campaings, usually at least weekly, mainly email marketing
* Different funnels and marketing automations on the ecommerce and its blog
* Conversions, impressions, clicks and other similar metrics were impacted on every last google update, everytime the site is doing worse, regardless than I'm constantly improving.
* Highly seasonal niche.",0.98,53,82,r/SEO,2024-06-15T06:08:01.000Z,post,,t3_1dgbdjs,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1dgbdjs/23_years_old_ecommerce_site_blog_dying_slowly/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1dgbdjs/23_years_old_ecommerce_site_blog_dying_slowly/,t2_ndfo7he0d,Old-Professional1747,"The Reddit post discusses the gradual decline of a 23-year-old eCommerce site and blog.

I've been working on a project to address some of the pain points in link building, and I'd love to get your thoughts on it.

Running a SEO agency and doing this for 20+ clients manually with Hunter, Snov, Apollo, Ahrefs &amp; SEMrush, I've always found link building to be one of the most time-consuming and challenging aspects of the job.

So, I created LinkDR to use AI to automate much of the process.

Here's what it does:

1. Uses my strategies that I generally use (keyword SERP analysis, backlink gap tool with 5 competitors, broken backlinks, competitor best links profile)
2. Find email addresses on the contact forms or use Hunter API as a fallback
3. Write a personal outreach message

It really took a lot of time to do this for every single domain (4+ hours) to now less than 10 minutes.

Explain to me how they can provide links that cheap.,"Hey guys,

I'm in France and our company was reached to get a backlink from Le Point (which is a big news company DR 90+). Their pricing is 2900€ for the link and 2000+ for pushing it on social media for a few days.

I am browsing the web to gather some information, and I found some dudes on fiverr or websites that are well ranked, that offer to get backlinks from high authority news websites (Le Point is in that list) for 140€. I even found one guy from pakistan that does it for 32€.

I understand that the service provided by Le Point is a 1 hour interview and directly by their media team, probably good quality content and some stats provided afterwards, but I don't understand how someone can get a backlink that cheap when the service is that pricey.

Do you guys have an explanation, is it a scam (fiver, etc), or are they (le point) just fishing for suckers?

Edit: One more question: do you think it's worth it? I'm tempted to get some skyscraper going with the backlink, but that's some serious budget for our small agency.",0.94,47,33,r/SEO,2024-09-20T09:47:15.000Z,post,,t3_1fl86ga,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1fl86ga/explain_to_me_how_they_can_provide_links_that/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1fl86ga/explain_to_me_how_they_can_provide_links_that/,t2_rdimk,Trukmuch1,"The post is seeking an explanation for how certain services or individuals are able to offer backlinks at a very low cost.

Here is how to find relevant sites cheap and are not link farms. ,"Finding relevant sites is not easy and even when you find some, the site owner is just spamming articles with links for a price. 

So I have this little trick to find very niche relevant sites that you can outreach and usually they do not sell links and are easy to convince on a low price.

This is my unique method and I have not seen anyone doing anything like this. 

Here is how to do this. 

- Go to Flippa, empire flippers or similar platforms 
- Search for your niche
- Filter websites/e-commerce businesses 
- Filter site age to &lt;2 
- Copy the site urls you see 
- Filter sites that you think have enough traffic 
- Outreach 


These businesses are looking for an exit and they can get some extra bucks for a simple link. They get some money that they can add to MRR and sell for a higher price too, you get a highly relevant link for a great price.

This works for every niche. You can ask them to add your link into an existing ranking page or on a new post.

Hope this helps. I was thinking of starting a series of posts where I share unique tips related to SEO. Let me know if I should.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta went back and forth with Google’s lead litigator, John Schmidtlein, during the first day of the trial’s closing arguments, questioning whether another company could amass the money and data needed to develop a search engine that could eventually compete against Google.

“It seems to be very, very unlikely, if not impossible, under the current market conditions,” Mehta said. He added that it appeared odd to him that there is a marketplace where Google is making billions of dollars in profit yet nobody “is trying to enter into the market to cut into that profit.”

-Continuous updates on creating helpful articles  
-Capitalizing on serp snippets

"After July 5, Google will stop indexing websites that don't function on mobile devices.","After being introduced in 2016, Google's mobile-first indexing strategy is finally almost finished. The last phase won't be achieved until after July 5, 2024, though. After this date, a select few websites that were previously scanned by desktop Googlebot will convert to mobile Googlebot, according to Google's John Mueller.  
  
Mueller underlined that no changes are anticipated for the majority of domains, which are currently being scanned in this manner. After July 5, Googlebot Smartphone will be the only tool used for crawling and indexing the remaining websites. This implies that Google will stop indexing and ranking your website if it is not available on mobile devices.

To put it simply, Google indexing now requires mobile accessibility. The content on your website will be considered unindexable if it is completely inaccessible on a mobile device. In its attempts to give priority to mobile-friendly websites, Google has achieved a major milestone with this decision.  
  
It's crucial to remember that if your website isn't mobile-friendly, Google still may still index it. Instead, your site won't be indexed if it doesn't load or display on mobile devices. As long as the desktop version of your template loads well on mobile devices, you can still use a desktop-only template.

Googlebot Desktop will still be used by Google for some initiatives, such product listings and Google for Jobs. Because of this, Googlebot Desktop activity can still be seen in your server logs and reporting tools.

Sites like CNN, USA Today, LA Times and others are seeing their rented subdomains and subfolders dropping in rankings after they were hit by manual actions.

Google has started its enforcement of the new site reputation abuse policy by deranking or deindexing portions of websites from the Google Search index.

Google said today. Google’s Search Liaison said on X today, “It’ll be starting later today. While the policy began yesterday, the enforcement is really kicking off today.”

Ahrefs changed its positioning. It's not an all-in-one SEO tool anymore,"It's an all-in-one marketing intelligence platform.

To me, this is also an even more aggressive attack on the Semrush market share.

I talk to people a lot and often hear that Ahrefs is a product for advanced SEOs, while Semrush covers more areas of marketing, not just SEO.

I think this is a strong and correct move. And the correct focus on their strength - big data.

Why correct?

1. Because all the discussions about how SEO is NOT dead are not just happening for no reason. 
2. SEO is not dead, but for some types of sites, it is dead. 
3. SEO is not dead for Google, but there appears a fight for visibility in AI chats. 
4. And even if SEO dies, marketing will remain.

Ahrefs already has enough opportunities to talk about positioning itself more broadly.

Is SEO Even Worth It for Small Local Businesses Anymore?,"I run a small local service business, and like many of you, I’ve been heavily investing in SEO over the past few years. In 2021 and 2022, things were looking good. We saw solid organic growth for some of our higher-value services, and our rankings were strong, especially for a few key areas where we consistently ranked in the top 3. These services have a longer sales cycle but high lifetime value (LTV), and SEO was definitely helping to drive business.

But in 2023, everything fell apart, and I’m seriously questioning if SEO is still worth it for small, local businesses like mine. Here’s the rundown:

# 1. Freelancer/Agency Lost Focus on Our SEO

Up until mid-2023, we were working with an SEO freelancer who had a small agency, at first, was doing a solid job. But then they started focusing on his other side hustles, and we were no longer a priority. As their attention drifted, our rankings started to slip. They weren’t proactive about the changes happening, and it became clear they were more invested in their new projects than in maintaining our SEO performance. 

# 2. The 2023 Google Core Update Wiped Us Out

Then, the Google core update in summer 2023 hit, and it was a disaster. We saw our rankings drop overnight, and the freelancer didn’t even notice until we pointed it out. They had forgotten to send reports for 3 months and weren’t monitoring the changes at all. The worst part? Our core services, which we rely on for daily revenue, had never even ranked in the top 50. We were blind to just how bad things were.

# 3. Failed Promises from SEO Agencies

After parting ways with the freelancer, we tried hiring another SEO company that promised to handle both SEO and PPC. Their pitch sounded great, but it quickly became clear they didn’t understand the basics—like how essential landing pages are for driving conversions. After a few months, we realized we weren’t going to see any results from them either, and we cut our losses.

Then, we hired an SEO expert out of Denver, thinking their expertise would make a difference. We paid them $2,500 over 3 months, expecting to see at least some improvement. But again, nothing changed—no gains in rankings or traffic. They were also not to keen to keep our business when I expressed my concerns and their lack of it. 

# 4. The Ukraine SEO Experiment

Our last attempt was hiring an SEO company from Ukraine, thinking maybe a fresh perspective would work. We paid $1,800 for SEO and link building, but now it’s almost the end of the year, and we’ve seen zero progress. No increase in traffic, no ranking improvements—just more frustration. They send reports, but it’s clear there’s no real movement. Their lack of communication and inconsistent tasks performance also made me worry if the war in Ukraine is affecting them or if I am just being taken for a fool, again. 

# 5. PPC is the Only Thing Working

The only marketing effort that’s actually shown any results for us this year has been PPC. It’s driven more leads and inquiries, but even finding someone who can handle bot SEO effectively has been tough. I’ve tried hiring on Upwork and other platforms, but it’s hard to find someone truly competent who delivers results.

After spending tens of thousands of dollars on SEO in 2023, I’m really starting to wonder if SEO is even worth it for small, local businesses anymore. It worked well for us in 2021 and 2022, especially for a few specific services, but our core offerings never ranked well, and the rest of this year has been a nightmare. Between failed SEO agencies, the Google core update, and the lack of results, it feels like SEO is just a money pit.

Has anyone else had similar experiences? Has SEO actually worked for any small businesses this year, or are we all just wasting our time and money? Right now, I’m seriously considering giving up on SEO altogether and focusing on PPC, which at least produces results.

Client Died - What to do with website? ,"A former client of mine died around a year ago. I didn't notice until about a year later after Googling his name..

2) I don't think his mom would know what to do with the website, should we just offer to sell it and send her the proceeds?

You Can Recover From HCU Damage With Next Core Update :: Google,"Google once again said you can recover from the damage inflicted on your site by the September 2023 helpful content update with the next core update. Danny Sullivan, the Google Search Liaison, said on X, ""Yes, people who have had impacts with core ranking updates may see changes (if our systems believe they've improved) after the next broad one we have.""

Sullivan was not able to say when that next core update will happen but he said when it does and if enough changes are made to your site, than you can recover with that next core update.

Sullivan posted on X in response to this question:

QUESTION:

Hey Searchliaison is there any rough estimate on the next core update, please? If I remember correctly JohnMu suggested recovery from the HCU could be possible with the next one (maybe even before) but it’s very tough to stay positive right now with our visibility suppressed.

ANSWER:

I know people keep referring to the helpful content system (or update), and I understand that -- but we don't have a separate system like that now. It's all part of our core ranking systems.

Which leads to, yes, people who have had impacts with core ranking updates may see changes (if our systems believe they've improved) after the next broad one we have. This explains more about that.

I don't have timing to share, but we do them several times during the year.

Semrush has the worst cancel subscription flow among SEO tools,"You may hate Ahrefs for its credit system, but they don't require you to look for the canceling button for 5 minutes.

Don't get me wrong.

Adding the user poll after clicking 'Cancel' is the normal step and is already very popular in the SaaS space. We are doing it at Sitechecker too.

The most unpleasant thing consists of 2 things:

1 I was looking for the unsubscribe button for 5 minutes.

2 It's not even called the Cancel button. It's called 'Contact Us'. They are deliberately misleading and stressing me into thinking that the only way I can cancel is by contacting support.

Then I can cancel the subscription myself, but this unpleasant trail remains throughout the entire process.

I believe that their product managers managed to slightly reduce the churn rate using these hacks. 

But I am sure that such a flow reduces the percentage of subscription reactivations on the other hand.

"Negative Google reviews keep piling up, feeling stuck","I’ve been running my small restaurant for about 10 years now. It’s just a small team—only 7 of us—so every review really counts. We depend on our reputation, especially on Google, to get people in the door.

Recently, though, things have taken a turn. One customer who wasn’t happy about something (that we could’ve easily fixed) started leaving bad reviews. Okay, I get it, not every customer is gonna be happy. But here’s the kicker—they started using fake names and leaving more one-star reviews over and over. I’m talking like every couple of hours.

It’s obvious it’s the same person, but Google doesn’t seem to care. I’ve flagged the reviews, tried reaching out, and they’ve only taken down ONE of them. Meanwhile, my restaurant’s reputation is getting dragged through the mud.

"Google sent me an email concerning low traffic to my Sports blog, and suggest I pay for Ads to help boost my presence in search and ranking","Here are a few points I noticed in the email, they were suggesting if I pay $500 Ill get another $500 in ad credit to help me rank and see a 400 percent increase in traffic to my blog. My sports blog is 12 years old and lost all traffic in the last two years since these updates, I literally get only 50 visits a day, dont even rank in google news anymore. Its even worse now. But this is weird so I guess it is true if you want to rank you better pay thousands in Ads for Google, no more stories of those who just rank organically. 

But whats also interesting is Google punishes those who pay to get links or such, but yet its okay for you to pay to Google to rank via ads on top of search or placements on other websites.

The SEO industry is a disgusting pit of slime-ball churn factories... ,"I've worked in digital/creative marketing for awhile now, first in the corporate world and now running my own agency. The number of business owners I speak to who are paying $500-$2000 per month for SEO and are receiving an automated ""white-label"" keyword ranking email every two weeks and nothing else is astounding.

I'm convinced most agencies are fine with matching or just beating churn with sales production and scaling sales...

For other (honest) agency owners and SEOs out there, do you see this as well? What is the best way to rescue these abused customers, avoid setting bad or unattainable expectations again and actually provide them with a service that works? For instance, I just spoke to a couple who own a small business, they're paying $800 per month for ""SEO"" and ""website management"", half of the services on their website are unrelated to the services they actually offer, and their site is rarely updated. The only thing their getting is a monthly keyword ranking report that's purposefully difficult to read and hard to decipher.

I would love to win their business, but if they're already unhappy and feel that SEO is a huge waste of money, is there a way to re-convince them or retrain them to see that SEO is not easy, takes time, and fast results are not a guarantee? Also, I feel like I would be lying if I told them everything's going to be okay and we can help them rank for local keywords. Even though they're easy keywords and we could rank for them now, Google is such a cluster at the moment and SEO in general seems to be in turmoil with AI and everything happening with marketshare, etc. things could change drastically in the next 6 months.

I'm droning on at this point, but would love advice/thoughts on this.

TLDR: I speak with business owners on a regular basis who are getting absolutely screwed by ""SEO"" agencies. How do you sign these clients and keep them happy for the long term without setting unrealistic expectations and risking repeating a similar experience?

March Core Update : New Google Ranking Factor ? Need Your Help To Confirm,"I believe I'm getting closer to understanding what Google did and why so many sites have tanked. Before I share my data with you I need your help in finding some outliers. Please share sites with me that do not fit my current understanding of the update.  


**My Take On The Update** 

Google has added social proof as a ranking factor. This is a trust signal. Google is using Social Media presence as trust signal. Sites are required to have social media presence to rank well in Google. Social proof is something like an ""EEAT"" factor that tells Google these sites are real and have a person behind it, they are not AI / Content farms. Sites that do not meet this Social Proof factor will find themselves in Social Sandbox. These sites still appear in Google but are no longer trusted. This social proof factor now replaces links as a trust signal. It doesn't matter how many links you have or how good your link profile is, to rank well and get a lot of traffic from google you need social proof.   


Sites that have social proof but are deemed spammy with be hit with manual action penalty.  


This factor replaces links as a trust signal. Links are still important but you need to have social media presence for it to matter.

We all know that ranking on Google has been getting easier with the help of AI. AI content and AI aided link building has made Google a punching bag for anyone into ""Programatic SEO"". Google needed to respond and they have responded by changing how trust is given.

Social Media presence easily filters out sites that are only built for Google Search.

This is were I need your help. Every site that I've found to have done well post update has social proof. Sites that have tanked do not have social proof or it's not strong enough.   


**Some examples of Winners:**

Yelp Are suing Google for anti-trust / creating a monopoly,"Hot off the heals of the DOJ success, Yelp have filed.

  
from Yelp's site:

&gt;Today, Yelp filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google in federal court in San Francisco. Our case is about Google, the largest information gatekeeper in existence, putting its heavy thumb on the scale to stifle competition and keep consumers within its own walled garden. Abandoning its stated mission to deliver the best information to users, Google has illegally abused its monopoly in general search to dominate the local search and local search advertising markets—engaging in anticompetitive conduct that has degraded the quality of search results and demoted rivals to grow its market power. 

&gt;Yelp has long fought to make Google’s local search experience more helpful for consumers and create a level playing field for competing vertical search services. With our action, we aim to safeguard competition, protect consumer choice, recover damages, and prevent Google from engaging in anticompetitive practices so that innovation may flourish.

What are your thoughts on this? Google has held such a gigantic market share that it's hard to imagine. But would the way of doing SEO change that much? Most opinions I heard are that SEO efforts work for bing just as well as they do for Google. 

I guess many folks would be glad if another Google core  update would not automatically mean that you're forced to start over with your SEO efforts because you're getting traffic from other search engines too. But as another redditor noted here, algo updates are the reason why SEO is still a profitable market for agencies and freelancers in the first place as they have to pick up the pieces of their client's websites.

GA4 Backlinks Report Template in Looker Studio,"4 years ago I created a template in Looker Studio to monitor traffic dynamics and conversions by all referrals in Universal Analytics.

Now I updated it to GA4. And ready to give you it for free. Comment something under this post and I will send it personally via messages.

Why is this template so valuable?

1. Monitor real traffic from backlinks, which you can't do in Ahrefs.
2. Find some backlinks that you will never find in Ahrefs (for example, backlinks from non-public websites like Jira Workspaces).
3. Measure the traffic performance of your parasite SEO campaigns.
4. Recognize new backlink leaders by traffic using the performance map.
5. Recognize lost opportunities when traffic declines from previously popular backlinks.

How to use the template?

1/ GA4 Page Refferer dimension includes both traffic from external and internal URLs by default. That’s why I created a custom field that helps to filter these two types of traffic.

You should use an external referrals-only filter to get a meaningful report.

2/ It’s a pity that GA4 adds all types of backlinks (social and search too) to the report, but you can easily filter them.

Update the filter ‘exclude junk websites’ to exclude some additional non-valuable websites from the report or create your own filter to exclude all social backlinks.

3/ Use the screen scale at 90% to avoid horizontal scrolling. The report will not fit on the entire screen if you use 100% zoom.",0.98,39,329,r/SEO,2024-07-13T12:31:45.000Z,post,Case Study,t3_1e29bk8,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1e29bk8/ga4_backlinks_report_template_in_looker_studio/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1e29bk8/ga4_backlinks_report_template_in_looker_studio/,t2_172dm4,Ivan_Palii,The Reddit post discusses a template for generating backlinks reports using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) in Looker Studio.

What to Make of the Google Leaks?,"In recent days, a massive leak of confidential Google documents has caused significant upheaval in the SEO industry.

But what’s really behind this? Do we now understand how the Google ranking algorithm works? Can we still trust anything Google says, and what happens next?

Yes, it’s true that the recent leaks provide us with deeper insights into the Black Box – and the revelations are quite explosive:

🏆 Google evaluates the authority of websites on specific topics using a ""siteAuthority"" metric – Google previously claimed this metric didn't exist.

📊 User behavior, such as clicks, dwell time, and bounce rates, directly influence rankings – contrary to previous statements.

📈 Click data from Chrome usage is used for ranking adjustments – again, contrary to earlier statements.

Many insiders now feel misled by Google. And it's somewhat understandable.

Google has repeatedly stated that they do not use Domain Authority as a ranking factor. In reality, they call it siteAuthority.

Google has long vehemently claimed that clicks and dwell time are not ranking factors. Instead, Google has tried to sell SEOs on the idea of complex systems like RankBrain as ranking factors. It’s now clear that a system called NavBoost does indeed use user signals, particularly click data, to determine the relevance and quality of search results for navigational queries.

In one of his Hangouts, John Mueller specifically said, “I don’t think we use anything from Google Chrome for ranking.” Naturally, this statement now looks bad within the SEO community, especially coming from someone who seemed to be “on the SEOs’ side.”

The realization is that Google uses semantics, rather than a secret and incredibly ingenious technology. Perhaps this is the real disappointment. Most SEOs (myself included) have eagerly spread Google’s high-tech PR because it also helped our business models.

So, what concrete lessons can we learn from the Google leaks? In my view, there are no genuinely new insights for SEO work.

Rather, it’s a confirmation of factors that were already largely understood.

* Links remain important.
* Page titles are matched with search queries.
* Authorship is a ranking factor.
* YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) pages are treated separately.

Conclusion: To rank well, you need relevant and user-friendly content.

"SEO News: Google Expands Site Reputation Abuse Policy, Merchant Center Recommendations Now In Google Analytics, OpenAI Might Launch a Web Browser, beyond","***Updates***

* **November 2024 Core Update Still Rolling Out**

Here are some key insights from Glenn Gabe:

* Recovery for some review sites previously hit by review updates
* Significant drops across the education affiliate niche

With the rollout expected to last around two weeks, we’re nearing the finish line. Soon, we’ll have enough data to analyze the update’s impact in detail.

And on to something that isn’t an update, but deserves your undivided attention:

* **Google Expands Its Site Reputation Abuse Policy**

Previously, this policy targeted third-party websites exploiting another site’s ranking signals. Now, it includes first-party sites—those hosting content from third parties that is atypical for the main site, regardless of the site owner’s level of involvement.

While penalties are still issued manually, Google is improving its algorithms that identify “if a section of a site is independent or starkly different from the main content of the site. By treating these areas as if they are standalone sites, it better ensures a level playing field, so that sub-sections of sites don't get a ranking boost just because of the reputation of the main site.”

Google went on to add that:

“This doesn't mean that these sub-sections have somehow been demoted or are in violation of our spam policies. It means we're measuring them independently, even if they are located within a site.”

Note that if you were hit by a penalty, Google warns not to move the affected directories to a new location on the domain name—it could result in further penalties or even site-wide repercussions.

***Tidbits***

* **DOJ May Push Google to Sell Chrome**

While no decision has been made, if the judge orders a sale, Chrome could be valued at $15–$20 billion.

Google argues that separating Chrome from the company would negatively impact other products and harm users.

Other potential penalties include:

* Restricting Android from running Google Search.
* Banning default search deals with Apple and others. For instance, Firefox, which generates part of its revenue through its agreement with Google.

The DOJ is also considering restrictions on Google’s AI activities, proposing a ban on acquisitions, investments, or collaborations for developing AI features.

There’s no decision just yet. A two-week hearing in April will determine what remedies Google must adopt to address its illegal practices, with a final ruling expected by August 2025.

In the meantime,

* **OpenAI Might Launch a Web Browser**

The creator of ChatGPT has hired former Google engineers, including Ben Goodger and Darin Fisher, who were key contributors to the original Chrome project. OpenAI has reportedly discussed its browser plans with companies like media giant Conde Nast, Eventbrite, Redfin, and Priceline.

* **Perplexity Launches AI-Powered Shopping Search**

Available now for paid users based in the US, this new feature includes:

* Visual product cards with detailed information
* One-click checkout
* An innovative merchant program that could reshape the online shopping experience.

Perplexity also promises “unbiased” product recommendations without sponsored slots.

* **Google Tests Removing EU-Based News Publishers From Search**

*“..a small, time-limited test in which we don't show results from EU-based news publishers in Google News, Search, and Discover. This test will affect 1% of users in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain.”*

Ready for a twist?

Just a day after Google made its plan public, the Paris Commercial Court swiftly ruled that the text violates an existing agreement with the French Competition Authority. Google now faces a choice: either scrap the test or pay €900,000 per day. Unsurprisingly, the search giant decided to remove France from the test.

The aim of the test is to find out how Google Search, Discover, and News affect traffic to EU publishers’ websites and, consequently, how much Google should pay them for reusing their news.

brightonSEO April 2024 notes,"Last week, our team attended brightonSEO, one of Europe’s biggest SEO conferences, and we’re thrilled to pass along the insights we gathered. While most of the event’s discussions revolved around SGE, we included additional notes on other topics. We hope you discover something intriguing in our findings. This year’s speakers were a joy to listen to, each offering a glimpse into the future of SEO. Off we go!

**SGE**

All speakers were on the same page about SGE. Google’s new search experience is not ready for the rollout and probably won’t be released on Google I/O (May 14th, 2024). Meanwhile, the speakers (and many other experts) compared SGE snippets to featured snippets, highlighting that the industry had already experienced a similar shift (when Google started to provide more information directly in the search). 

SEOs believe the main SEO principles will remain the same in the new search (SGE). But the industry doesn’t currently have SGE performance tracking tools (only manual checks).

Also, one speaker (Marcus Tober) had quite a fresh opinion on this: It’s easier for Google to grow revenue through ecommerce rather than through the development of AI. For example, today’s lack of diversity in ecommerce organic search results on SERPs helps Google get more clicks on ads (Google wants to become the catch-all solution for ecommerce).

Here are some of the speakers’ main points:

* SGE still looks like it’s in its preliminary stages. It should not be rolled out in its current form, but investors may exert pressure on its launch. 
* SEOs should expect a less radical departure from traditional search. Expect evolution, not revolution.
* Traffic erosion may unfortunately occur, with a potential traffic decline of up to 30-70%. Meanwhile, organic traffic will become more valuable as organic results space in SERPs shrinks.
* The highest satisfaction in SGE usage is among users 18-24 years old (based on Google’s report).
* Paywall content appearing in SGE results might cause legal issues.
* Open AI and Perplexity aren’t a threat to Google’s search business.
* Some sites with low domain trust/weak backlink profiles/no organic traffic can be found in SGE.
* Google is forced to grow revenue, which is easier in ecommerce than through AI. Search currently gives less diversity in ecommerce results -&gt; people click on ads more 
* There’s no need to target easy informational searches. But this already started with featured snippets.

**Limits to SGE**

* Potential legal issues like stolen content (cases like these also occurred with featured snippets) and unsourced materials, misleading info, non-EU data centers, etc
* UX issues: SGE often has little benefit over the regular search, and Bing has already been backtracked
* Spam and misinformation
* Commercial limitations and a need to find a new monetization method (Google might incorporate a paid-only feature)
* Computation might be the biggest problem

**Ranking factors that likely will not change for SGE:** 

* Text relevance &amp; content quality (AI content can be a threat to websites)
* Backlinks (it’s easier to produce content than getting good links)
* User experience
* User signals (might become the most important ranking factor)

**Other observations (on the topics):**

* Trending topics: There was much discussion around content production with AI (ChatGPT), plus talks on brand building, PR, and alternative traffic channels.
* AI Content &amp; ChatGPT: Focus on prompt generation and improving the quality of generated content (and humanizing it). Creating &amp; training your own ChatGPT chat appears to be a trend.
* Technical SEO: There were fewer talks on speed and Core Web Vitals (or even no talks). There were more talks (and interest) on log file analysis.

And finally, kudos to all the great speakers for their hard work! Here are some of my favorite talks (though there are many more ones I’d love to pick up on):

* Malcolm Coles (Creating a dashboard for keyword tracking)
* Neil Barnes (Storytelling)
* Jonjo Rowlands (ChatGPT for content creation)",0.9,37,5,r/SEO,2024-05-02T13:36:49.000Z,post,,t3_1cifvag,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cifvag/brightonseo_april_2024_notes/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cifvag/brightonseo_april_2024_notes/,t2_uhf0wrxd,SE_Ranking,"The Reddit post discusses notes from the brightonSEO conference held in April 2024.

Massive traffic drop since 2023,"I have run a relatively successful travel blog for the past 10+ years. All 700+ articles are written by me. I use no AI, no stock photography. All posts are creative and well researched. We accept no sponsored posts even though we have been contacted by companies like Patagonia at one point. Many of my posts are quite unique and weird content that you would not find elsewhere - basically I do not write just for search rankings. Unfortunately, many people have attempted to copy my posts over the years, which is truly pathetic as they use all stock photos and write generic (I didn't do it myself) content.

I have put so much time and effort into this blog - took every picture, paid for everything, supported hundreds of local businesses with absolutely nothing in return, hiked 100's of miles, traveled through blizzards and monsoons, took 4-8 hour road trips several times per month, explored cities across the US. I have even moved over 20 times to get a local perspective on each area vs being a weekend tourist.

At its' highest point, my blog was receiving over 3.5 million page views per year. In 2020, I started losing traffic probably due to covid (around 1 million views that year).

Each year since 2020, I have lost massive traffic. Last year, page views dropped to 322,000. This year has been the lowest ever with only 40,000 page views in the past 6 months. Over 70% of my articles ranked on the first or second page of Google for many years, many in the zero or first position.

Today, these popular posts are indexed, although I can't find them even if I scroll to page 25+. How a post stayed at number 1 (above big business sites like Forbes, Travel and Leisure, and all the ""Visit X"" cities) for so many years then dropped to page 25+ all of a sudden is beyond me. Basically Google is taking every post that was on page 1 or 2 and putting it on page 10 or lower. Strangely, the more popular the post was at one time, the more it is completely out of search.

I verified that there are no manual actions, core web vitals ok, and verified that there are no bad backlinks.

I was wondering if anyone has any opinions on what would be causing this massive change. We are 100% confident the content and design are not a factor.

"SEO News: Spam update, Google I/O, GPT-4o, Apple is considering a partnership with OpenAI","**Updates**

The anticipated second wave of the spam update has begun

But it’s a bit of a Schrödinger’s cat situation—it has and hasn’t started at the same time. Google is deliberately not rushing to notify us about anything, even though sites have already started getting penalized.

When asked why the update hasn't been announced on the dashboard, Sullivan replied that only manual actions are currently being issued, while the algorithmic part hasn't begun yet.

On the bright side, there are already cases where manual penalties have been successfully removed from sites, leading to their search visibility being restored.

To recap, this “part” of the Spam Update concerns the Site reputation abuse policy, which Google announced in March along with Scaled content abuse and Expired domain abuse. Another point that must be mentioned is that Google has recently emphasized that Site reputation abuse isn't about linking; it’s about using another domain's reputation for your own benefit.

Product review summary labels

Brief highlights of product features on review cards. Google is now showing these short summaries of reviews by placing a label over the review with one or a few words. So the labels might show ""low quality,"" ""compact,"" ""lightweight,"" ""performs well"" and so on.

(to come) Number of shoppers next to site

Google plans to display the number of recent shoppers on your site in its search results. We’re talking about labels like ""1K shopped here recently,"" data on which will be pulled from your Merchant Center. 

The idea is to ""build shopper confidence in your business.""

However, many users are unhappy with their sales stats becoming publicly available even in this format. For such users, Google provides an option to opt out. But keep in mind that even then, Google will continue to use your data ""to power various annotations and features that benefit your performance.""

**Tidbits**

1) Yesterday’s Google I/O presentation

The search giant has announced their new developments related to AI.

Here’s what stood out: SGE is finally going live this week under the name AI Overviews. For the time being, it will only be available to users in the US “with more countries coming soon”.

Danny Sullivan claims that the feature has almost fully been rolled out. He also mentioned that people use search more when this feature is available, and are ultimately more satisfied with the results. And all of this comes despite SGE’s earlier advice suggesting that users drink urine to treat kidney stones.

Oh, well..)

A number of other new features were announced, which will be available only for the US market in English through Search Labs:

* Ask complex questions that require multi-step planning.
* Interrupt answer generation to refine or modify your query.
* Plan ahead, like meal plans for three days.
* For broad queries, AI will group results into subcategories (see example for clarity).
* Google Lens will now work not only with photos but also with live videos—you can film something and ask questions about what's in the frame.

We must mention that OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman decided to steal some of Google’s thunder by releasing a new product that “feels like magic” just a day before the search colossal’s I/O.

Everyone speculated about what it might be—a search engine, a voice assistant... Altman said that the team has been working extra hard on the update, and it turned out to be quite the gem.

2) The super product turned out to be GPT-4o

What makes GPT-4o so gosh darn fantastic?

The big news is that the team over at OpenAI has improved its multimodal voice assistant. Now it clearly understands text, photos, and videos. 

Moreover, you can talk to the model in real-time, get it to translate conversations, understand and explain code, share your camera and ask questions about what’s in the view. To boot, I was just blown away by its ability to sing, tell stories with intonation, and keep a conversation going even if I occasionally interrupt it.

The best part? Chat mode will be free for everyone!

Plus, the API will be available at half the cost of Turbo, with five times the usage limits and twice the speed. We'll start getting access to this amazing tool in the coming weeks.

They also hinted at real-time search features, but this wasn't included in the final demo.

3) By the way, Apple is considering a partnership with OpenAI

Their goal is to make ChatGPT available on iPhones, starting with iOS 18, which will open up a whole range of AI-powered possibilities for Apple smartphone device owners.

For context, there have already been discussions that Siri “doesn't measure up” by modern standards and needs a “brain transplant.”

How is this possible?,"I am in a rabbit hole because of a competitor.

I have been doing SEO for 10+ years and I have never seen this.

They have 5x more traffic than other top 5 competitors combained.  
They did something last August and since then they jumped from 5000 monthly impressions to 70.000!  
YES you are seeing this correctly, they had over 130.000 impressions in september 2024, while top 5 competitors (including my client) had 50.000 combained.

We had another significant overall position drop in the end of October 2024 and I am trying to figure out what is happening.



My research brought me so far to:  
they started a sister website (dfferent domain, more services included) and for one of our main keywords they rank number 1 on Google (article is 5 months old, as most of their website content)

I went deeper, added them (new found competitor) into my ubersuggest and in may 2024 they had 5000 monthly traffic, November 2024 26.000, with the start of massive growth from June/July (the date of the mentioned article above)

How can you get 5x more traffic in 5 months (who has a SEO growth month on month more than 20% or 30% every month??)

I went to schema validator and they have some dodgy (not appropriate schemas) and the ones I see for the first time e.g.

WPHeader, CreativeWork and hatom (what is a hatom schema??)

I am confused how can you not be at all shown on some keywords 6 months ago, and then today have a number one position for the keyword that is not even your main service, or your content is not focused on that topic. 

How can you get in 5 months on Google, that usually (if you go normal seo optimization) routes you need years of content creation, optimization and technical seo.

Has Anyone Successfully Used ChatGPT for SEO? Looking for Practical Tips!,"Hey everyone! 

I've been using ChatGPT to help me write SEO content, and while it’s been helpful, I’ve run into a few challenges and wanted to see if anyone has had better success with it.

Here’s my current process:

1. **Keyword research** is still a manual task. I haven’t found ChatGPT very useful here, so I end up doing it all myself, which feels a bit slow.
2. **Content writing** is where ChatGPT helps, but if I let it run wild, the output often feels too “AI-ish” and lacks the human touch. The SEO results also aren’t great unless I give it detailed input and writing directions.

I feel like I’m not fully leveraging AI’s potential for SEO, especially when it comes to scaling high-quality content.

So, does anyone have any practical tips or successful strategies they’ve used to make ChatGPT (or any AI) more effective for SEO?  
Some specific questions:

* Have you found a better way to integrate AI into **keyword research**?
* How do you make AI-generated content feel more natural and **human-like**?
* What’s the best method to **streamline content creation** while still keeping quality high?
* Any tips on combining **other automation tools** with ChatGPT to save time?

Free Tools I've Used for Years to Find Long-Tail Keywords,"**Today, I’m sharing my process for finding long-tail keywords that can rank using a free tool. If you’re an experienced SEO, you’ve probably heard of this before, but I’m sharing it anyway for those just starting out.**

# 1. Log in or Sign up for a Google Ads Account

**Tip: You can use the Keyword Planner in Google Ads without spending any money on ads.**

* Go to **Tools &gt; Planning &gt; Keyword Planner**.

# 2. Discover New Keywords

* **Click on “Discover New Keywords.”**
* You have two options here:**a) Start with keywordsb) Start with a website**
   * Enter any words or phrases related to your niche. The tool will generate keyword ideas based on your search terms.
   * For example, if your niche is fitness, you might start with “best cardio exercises for weight loss” or “best home workout with dumbbells.”
   * Enter a website related to your niche. It will scan the website and provide relevant keyword ideas.

**Tip: Remember to choose the right location for your keyword research.**

# 3. Refine Your Keyword List

* **Filter and Sort:** Add filters to narrow down your list based on competition or search volume. Sort your list to prioritize the best keywords for your needs.
* **Refine Keywords:** Go to the “refine keywords” section, and exclude irrelevant terms or brands you don’t sell. This will remove the corresponding keywords from your results.

**Tip: “Text match” shows keywords that contain the text you entered, while “Semantic match” shows keywords with a similar meaning.**

# 4. Check Out &amp; Refine Keyword Suggestions

* **Browse the Keyword Suggestions:** Check the list of generated keyword ideas along with details like average monthly searches, 3-month change, competition levels, etc.

**Tip: Download your keyword list for easy reference and planning.**

# 5. Understand Search Volume and Trends

* **Analyze Data:** Look at the average monthly searches to see how popular a keyword is. Check if the interest in the keyword is growing or declining.
* **Seasonal Trends:** If you’re in a seasonal niche, like winter fashion, analyze the search volume trend chart—it can provide super useful insights.

**Tip: Look for keywords with a high volume of searches but low competition.**

# 6. Plan Your SEO Strategy

* **Pick the Low-Hanging Keywords:** Choose high-volume, long-tail keywords that are relevant to your content.
* **Focus on Intent:** Make sure your chosen keywords match what people are actually looking for.

**Tip: A high level of competition usually suggests high commercial search intent.**

# Bonus Tips:

* I use the **Keyword Golden Ratio (KGR)** as an extra step to filter out long-tail keywords. I didn’t invent KGR; credit goes to Doug Cunnington (link to his blog post).

# 7. Use the Keyword Golden Ratio (KGR)

* Select only keywords with monthly searches below 250.
* Search on Google: **“allintitle: your long-tail keyword here”**. This shows the number of websites with the exact combination of your long-tail keywords in the meta title.
* Use the KGR formula: **Number of allintitle Google results divided by search volume**.

If it’s below 0.25, it’s a great long-tail keyword, and you should rank in the top 100 pretty soon.

A simple guide for natural linkbuilding,"Hello!  
I just wanted to share my thoughts on a few things that I have noticed over the years, which have caused websites to be punished or misused by *Google's systems*.  
The main goal for most companies on the internet is to make as much money as possible while still giving good results to customers. Finding this balance might be hard, but giving up on one of the two could destroy the whole company.  
**Unrealistic approach to backlinks**. They sell backlinks that are really bad in every way possible. Even if the DR/DA seems better than average and the customer thinks that these links are fine, when you look at these backlinks individually and where they link to, it's clear that most are just spam. Some might not think this is a big deal, but *the backlinks you get affect your site's quality directly*. For example, if you have a company selling shoes and Google sees your site has linked to websites with illegal things, it can hurt your site's reputation and the linking site's too.  
**Backlink overkill**. Google's algorithms have changed a lot over the years, making it harder for SEO companies to get fast results for customers. This leads to what I call the ""backlinking overkill strategy."" I see this a lot, when they get a new client, SEO agencies want to get the most for them in the shortest time. So, they come up with plans to get 20–30 backlinks a month, increasing gradually, which just looks like spam to everyone.  
**The secret sauce**. The trick is to build a natural backlink profile, which many SEO experts I have talked to agree on. This is more important than just getting 20 links a month in a predictable pattern. The key is to make it look like real people are doing it. For example, in Month 1: 5 backlinks; Month 2: 3 backlinks; Month 3: 9 backlinks; and Month 4: 1 backlink. This often goes unnoticed by Google, unlike the steady increase of 20 links each month, which can quickly get you banned from Google's systems.

Google Update? 20th Oct-2024,"Hi, 

  
One of my client have seen some ranking drop from 20th of October (85% keywords down) here are the details

1. Keywords were in top 5 are now in between 7-10
2. 10-20% of the keywords move to 2nd.3rd page and still dancing their rankings on daily basis. 
3. Also 15% of the keywords saw an improvement in ranking so I think this is not something sitewide. 

Store Details: This is an apparel ecommerce store which have around 40-50K organic traffic on its category pages (other than brand/blogs) and from 20th October, their traffic is down approximately 20-25% 

  
Here are my concerns:

1. Any news on update (no official announcement yet) but anyone else observing this behavior?
2. What are the possibilities when your 85% of the keywords showing downward trend? Is it something related to domain?
3. We haven't done anything (new) on the store so cannot connect the dots here. 
4. The ranking was stable on primary keywords from last 6-7 years so the domain also have the authority on the niche.
5. The client also have regional stores with the same infrastructure (UK/AU etc) and all are fine. This happened in only USA.

SEO should be called SEM: Search Engine Manipulation,"*Ever since I started in SEO I found that the only 'true' SEO is on-page, that is were you can actually optimise things. 99% of off-page SEO should be called out for what it is: Search Engine MANIPULATION.*

* link building = obfuscated advertising (maybe 1% are true organic links)
* content/social media marketing = marketing, it's in the name
* Brand and reputation building = PR which has nothing to do with search directly.

I think there only ever was, and still is, only one rule in SEO: 

***Content is King.*** 

Write good (the best) content on your own site and it will (should) attract attention, from your target audience as well as seach engine. You can ofc draw extra attention to it, but call that what it is: PR and/or marketing. 

Keep in mind what the goal of a seach engine is: to provide their customers with the best answer to their query. The goal for you should not be ***to convice*** Google (by manipulating their algorithm) that you are the best, but ***to be*** the best result for the customer!

If you are the best result, Google will put all their billions at work to find you. If you want to manipulate the SERP, you'll have to spend all your time and effort chasing an ever changing algorithm (that is backed by those same billions).

* **Google Rolls Out November 2024 Core Update**

On November 11, 2024, Google began rolling out its third core update of the year: the (fittingly named) November 2024 Core Update.

As usual, Google kept details sparse, sticking to its standard advice: “Create content for people, not just for search engines.”

However, Glenn Gabe has gone a step further and started a diary specifically dedicated to tracking updates, sharing detailed observations along the way:

* Sites hit by the September 2023 Helpful Content Update are struggling to recover, with some seeing even worse results.
* On the flip side, there are signs of recovery for sites impacted by March and August Core Updates.

Here are some notable vertical shifts:

* Medical/Health: Significant volatility reported.
* Education Affiliates: Big drops continue (Forbes, anyone?).
* Gaming &amp; Entertainment: Some previously hit sites are making noticeable gains in visibility.

With ranking volatility still high as the update progresses, keep an eye on your analytics—and stay tuned for more insights!

Unpopular Opinion: Pagespeed is Critical ,"I’ve seen a lot of posts lately about pagespeed not being a huge factor in SEO. 

And I get it - some of my clients’ sites are on platforms that are slow (squarespace, go high level, etc) and they do well despite the bloated code. 

But I completely disagree with the idea that pagespeed ia not CRITICAL to SEO success for one reason…

CONVERSIONS!

If a page loads abysmally slowly, it will hurt its traffic and conversions. 

Full stop. 

As SEOs, our job is to get people ranked on search engines. Cool. 

But I think part of our job is to help clients profit from our efforts.

Slow page speeds hurt profitability. Which hurts our industry.

Google telling us backlinks are not important?,"I came across this article --- https://searchengineland.com/backlinks-seo-importance-442529#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAll%20in%20all%2C%20backlinks%20from,quality%20websites%20vouch%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D


these are some direct quotes from Google -- 
“I think they [links] are important, but I think people overestimate the importance of links. I don’t agree it’s in the top three. It hasn’t been for some time.”

“We need very few links to rank pages… Over the years we’ve made links less important.”

“My recommendation would be not to focus so much on the absolute count of links. There are many ways that search engines can discover websites, such as with sitemaps. There are more important things for websites nowadays, and over-focusing on links will often result in you wasting your time doing things that don’t make your website better overall.”

Toxic Client for SEO - Leave or Keep?,"Hi,

I have a client who has been with me for over a year. They are in a competitive, niche market with 3 physical stores in the same city they want to rank for. I have achieved top 10 rankings for majority of their keywords. In Google Search results they show up as #1 or #3 or #5 for all their top selling products.

This client scans keywords every single day and casts a country-wide net and I'm answerable every day. Sometimes the rank for some keywords drops 1 or 3 position country-wide (always recovering the following day) but I have to sit through a barrage of questions indicating that I don't know anything I am doing.

I have to take a lot of shit for refreshing descriptions and there is no patience to wait for results. Basically there should be NO DIP, EVER!

Today was another stressful day. Despite me explaining that Google was testing some things with backlinks yesterday and there will be an anomalies with rankings I was schooled on how their business is tanking because they lost major positions country-wide. Has anybody experienced the same?

Earned $127.11 in 2 days! The month of October has started,"I see a lot of posts about SEO every day. While some of these posts are useful for us, some are quite irrelevant. Here today, I would like to share with you the tactics that have been successful in the marketing of my own design tool.

First of all, I want to give you some information. 

About 10 months ago, my partner and I decided to create a design tool for you to create 2D-3D logos, tattoos, illustrations, AI art. It has been about 9 months since our launch.

Growth so far, 1.55 M total impressions, 64.5 clicks! We continue to increase our income every month! Since the launch, I have been generating income through the subscription model thanks to my design tool.

During the 6 months after the launch, we grew using only SEO and organic marketing strategies. Over the past 2 months, we have tried both paid marketing and organic marketing. However, this caused both our sales and our Google indexes to decline. For this reason, we decided to stop paid marketing this month and focus on organic marketing again.

Our site traffic this month is 350K impressions, 12.1K clicks and 3.3K revenue. We have generated our traffic with viral organic content and SEO. We are trying to improve our product every day and get the best experience for you.

Yesterday, 16.4K  impressions, 542 clicks!!

Although we are successful, we believe that the purchase rate is low!

How did we achieve this success? We had purchased a boilerplate to save time while creating our product. This boilerplate contained a marketing guide.

When I examined it carefully, startup directories and guest blog post sites were included in this guide to create high-quality backlinks. First of all, we started submitting our product to these sites!

With our launch, we started creating interesting social media posts. And we have made posts on social media pages that allow self-promotion.

We supported them with email marketing.

How Trimming Your Website Can Boost Rankings,"Hey guys,

I wanted to talk about something I don’t see getting enough attention but has (several times over) brought me a boost in results: content pruning. 

Although it’s not the ‘sexiest’ part of SEO, but trust me—it’s effective and can make a massive difference, especially if you’ve got a lot of content that’s been hanging around for years.

What is Content Pruning?

Content pruning is exactly what it sounds like: going through your existing content and trimming away (or improving) the stuff that’s not performing. 

You’re essentially cutting out the old, irrelevant, and underperforming pages that aren’t helping you rank—or worse, dragging down your site as a whole.

But this isn’t just about deleting a bunch of old blog posts. It’s a strategic process where you evaluate what content is worth keeping, improving, merging, or cutting altogether.

Why Prune Your Content?

Here’s the thing: Google rewards quality over quantity. If your site is bloated with outdated, irrelevant, or duplicate content, that’s gonna hurt your SEO efforts. Every page on your site is competing for Google’s attention, and if half of those pages aren’t adding value, they’re essentially diluting the power of the good stuff.

More pages = more chances for low-quality content to harm your rankings. It’s also worth mentioning that pruning can improve your site’s crawl efficiency, meaning Googlebot can focus on indexing the content that actually matters.


How to Implement Content Pruning: Step-by-Step

Here’s a process I follow when pruning a client’s website. It’s actionable, measurable, and—most importantly—gets results.

1. Audit Your Existing Content

Start by doing a complete content audit. Tools like Screaming Frog, Google Search Console, or even Ahrefs are great for this. The goal is to identify all the pages on your site and their performance metrics (traffic, rankings, backlinks, etc.).

Look at the following:

* Pages with zero or very low traffic over the past 6-12 months.
* Content that ranks for irrelevant or low-value keywords.
* Pages with thin content (i.e., not providing enough value or depth).
* Outdated posts that are no longer accurate or useful (think old news, obsolete stats, irrelevant services).

Export everything into a spreadsheet so you can start analyzing it.


2. Categorize Your Content

Now that you have your content audit, categorize your content into three buckets:

* Keep: High-performing pages that are still relevant. These are your MVPs—you don’t touch them unless it’s to optimize further.
* Improve: Posts or pages that have some value but need a refresh. Maybe it’s outdated, maybe the keyword strategy needs adjusting, or maybe it just needs more content depth.
* Remove/Redirect: Low-value content that’s either irrelevant or actively hurting your rankings.

3. Improve &amp; Consolidate

For the content in the “Improve” category, go through and optimize. Some ideas for improving content:

* Update statistics, examples, or case studies that are no longer accurate.
* Add more content to thin articles—longer content often performs better (but only if it’s relevant).
* Re-optimize for keywords: If a piece is ranking for a less-than-ideal keyword, adjust the content to target better, higher-value terms.
* Consolidate: If you have multiple posts on the same or similar topics, consider merging them into one comprehensive post. Use 301 redirects to point the old URLs to the new one, so you don’t lose any link juice.

4. Remove Low-Value Content

For content that’s past its prime and no longer useful, don’t be afraid to cut it. Deleting isn’t always the best option—you can 301 redirect these pages to more relevant content to preserve any backlinks or SEO value they still carry.


Pro Tip: If you have content that’s no longer relevant but you don’t want to delete it (e.g., an outdated service or product), consider deindexing it by using a noindex tag. This keeps it on your site for reference but removes it from Google’s index so it doesn’t hurt your rankings.


5. Measure the Impact

Once you’ve pruned your content, keep a close eye on your rankings, organic traffic, and crawl stats. Usually, within a few weeks or months, you’ll start seeing an improvement in keyword rankings and overall traffic. Use Google Analyticsand Search Console to track this.
Remember, content pruning is not a one-time thing. It’s a continuous process. Every six months or so, revisit your content and see if there’s anything new that needs attention.



TL;DR: Clean Up Your Content for Better SEO
If you’ve been putting off content pruning, now’s the time to do it. It’s a simple but powerful strategy to improve your site’s overall quality, ranking potential, and user experience. Start by auditing your site, categorizing your content, and deciding what to keep, improve, or remove. The results are well worth the effort.

What to do with 8.6 million 404 pages,"Hello everyone,

Last week, I joined an e-commerce company. Despite being established a few years ago, the company had not implemented any SEO strategies. The Google Search Console (GSC) had not been set up until I did it last week.

The results from the GSC crawl are in, and it turns out there are **8.6 million 404 pages** (yes, million). These errors occurred because items that sold out were automatically deleted by Shopify (yes, they're using Shopify and no, there's no plan to migrate for now).

The Real Reason For HCU Classifier (ELI5 explanation - 100% reality),"Let's make this short.

I think it's clear that we are past the point where all HCU-killed sites are considered garbage. Some are, but many aren't.

---------------------------------------

It's clear as a day that Google is all about money rather than surfacing quality right now - we have spam, forums, reddit, non-related sites ranking.

========================

So, what's REALLY happening!

Simple.

Google did this update to increase Google's time on site.

How ?

**By killing websites answering specific queries. E.g., 90% of niches sites.**

Why?

Because when the user makes a specific query and finds an answer (correct or not doesn't matter in this case), he/she leaves.

But when the user is shown only sites that target his keyword indirectly, he/she is more likely to make another Google search.

More google searches = more ad impressions = more ad clicks = more money.

=========================================================================

That's it.

Nothing to do with helpful content, EEAT or other bullshit.

Google makes more money by enshittifying the search results due to the extra queries.

And yes, Reddit is allowed to target specific queries, but the user still has to dig for it and is more likely to make another search +reddit.

------------------------------------------------------

Today, Google reported all time high revenue + all time high stocks + paying dividends.

So, it's working.

Short term or not.

They're winning right now.

Large websites starting to seize the opportunity google's offering,"One of my websites, let's call it the ""cash cow"", was impacted by recent Google updates (every update took around 20%). It hosts numerous genuine reviews and product comparisons, along with purely researched content. The focus was clearly on content gaps with low keyword difficulty. It is monetized via affiliate marketing and self-made ads suitable to the content. However, it lacks fundamental social media integration and an engaged community. I haven't invested much in backlinks, hoping to create natural growth with quality content (I know, it's naive).

So after HCU and spam updates, we observe that even loose connections to a search term (implying slight relevance) are sufficient for **high-authority sites such as forbes to take the lead**. In consequence, we see bigger sites **augmenting their content** with just 1-2 sentences to include side-topics, which surprisingly is enough to **outrank comprehensive, in-depth reviews** or comparisons dedicated to that topic.

An example: I wrote an in-depth comparison of two robotic lawn mowers, first-hand pictures showing them side by side. A big legacy site now added two sentences to an existing review article, which is sufficient to send me to position 2-4 (position two is now, where ads and videos begin to interfere) and cut my CTR from 40% to 20%... Annoyingly, I can see, they spend a lot of time on my site, minutes before they published the content. Probably it served as their source and of cause they will never praise my work with a backlink. That's not a single case, it starts happing everywhere. And tbh, I would do the same from a business perspective.

The only countermeasure is to share my content on platforms like Reddit and Quora to regain my position, but will also stop my revenue. It's a bizarre situation where a mere flicker—minimal content updates from these sites—can beat hours of meticulous work.

I feel like I got scammed,"I created a website on WIX Studio a few months ago for selling my service,  
  
I make custom kitchen cabinets, I did the basic setup for SEO inside WIX like the SEO checklist ( alt images and alt titles), I did all this after lots of research. but wanted to hire an expert to properly complete the SEO.  
  
I paid $2200 Cad to a highly ranked person on the wix platform and I feel like the things he did does not reflect the value I should be getting out of such a price, what I got from him is:

* Keywords research ( there already was keywords he just added some new ones )
* URL changes ( changed a few URLS as some pages got flagged as duplicates and needed simple changes )
* Localization ( added a drop down menu to the header that wrote ""Location"" once you click on one of the cities the URL changes to be in the location you choose )
* 2 meta descriptions were missing and he wrote them ( already made a lot of these but missed them for the two pages, rest were unchanged )
* Indexing through google console

Asked me to use medium to write blogs each week to help with off page SEO and backlinks rest was untouched.   
  
I feel like I got scammed as there are still a lot of images with no alt text and he did not even mention these not much on page text was changed very small changes and he did not say anything about the UI and UX which after research I found out it should be his job to at least tell me the loading speed and such are important ( after I confronted him about this he said I will fix it for you don't worry but did nothing )

"Forget the December Core Update, the December Spam Update is here","Spam updates. Google linked to its standard spam updates documentation that reads:

&gt;“While Google’s automated systems to detect search spam are constantly operating, we occasionally make notable improvements to how they work. When we do, we refer to this as a spam update and share when they happen on our list of Google Search ranking updates.

&gt;For example, SpamBrain is our AI-based spam-prevention system. From time-to-time, we improve that system to make it better at spotting spam and to help ensure it catches new types of spam.

&gt;Sites that see a change after a spam update should review our spam policies to ensure they are complying with those. Sites that violate our policies may rank lower in results or not appear in results at all. Making changes may help a site improve if our automated systems learn over a period of months that the site complies with our spam policies.

&gt;In the case of a link spam update (an update that specifically deals with link spam), making changes might not generate an improvement. This is because when our systems remove the effects spammy links may have, any ranking benefit the links may have previously generated for your site is lost. Any potential ranking benefits generated by those links cannot be regained.”

"Competitor with junk backlinks, how should I compete?","Hi all,

I'm not an expert in SEO by any means but I just want to hear people's advice on how to figure this situation out. I have no backlinks for my new site as of now, so I'm looking through one of my main relevant competitors backlink profile on semrush.  I've come across some pretty junk-ish websites that link to them and I can't tell if it's helping or hurting them, seems like helping. They are ranking high, usually #1, and steadily growing, no harsh drops offs/spikes from the keyword/traffic graphs.

They have 50K Backlinks, 48K being Follow. 1K Referring domains. 90% of them come from a single website which I'm going to assume they own too. The rest are all from a really wide array of random websites in various different languages/niches. Which leads me to believe they are just buying stuff off Fiverr or somewhere else.

Any filters or metrics I should narrow down on semrush to help me develop a plan to start competing with them?

Thanks for the help.

  
EDIT: I want to add that this competitor is not an ecommerce company, but they're backlinks are product pages on the company thats linking to them. Where the product is like a random part of the competitors website. The product description just describing said part of their website. The companies linking to them are sometimes not even ecommerce themselves, I came across a consulting company with a single product page along the lines of '?page=994023', that had litterally nothing to do with the consulting company.

Will a redirected direct match domain help my main site?,"I have a main site, lets call it ""Smith Autos"" which sells cars in Centreville. It's broad, selling all sorts of cars, vans, electric vehicles, etc. If I have a domain called ""electriccarscentreville.com"", what's the best way of leveraging that for my main site?

1) 301 redirect to Smith Autos, but build links to the direct match domain anyway so it ""shows up"" on Google's radar

2) Actually build a limited site but direct all product clicks to the main site. So the homepage will be ""electriccarscentreville.com"" but if someone clicks any of the product categories, they will be taken to the main Smith Autos site.

A new customer drops from the HCU,"good morning,



I've taken over a file from a new client and I don't really understand his downfall since September 2023, he started losing his keywords on September 18, the day of the HCU and his site is falling, he's in the process of rewriting his ecommerce site, he has a blog where he writes articles about his products. 



It's an ecommerce affected by the HCU.



I'm not sure how to get it back.



Organic traffic divided by 5, his blog went from 110k per month to 22k, his ecommerce site from 400 views per day to 30 views per day in his country. 



It's complicated, because sites with 4 lines are passing him by. 



Do you have any ideas? 

  
In June 2023 it had 904 keywords in the top 3, today 185. It is currently losing 5 top 3 keywords every 2 days.

Is My SEO Skill Still Profitable?,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out to you, fellow SEO enthusiasts, to share my thoughts and questions, hoping to have a conversation with you all. :)

I just turned 29. I'm married and living in Japan, where my wife works. I used to work at a digital agency doing SEO, handling clients like Best Western, Nuxe, Mont Blanc, and others.

I was able to help smaller businesses generate traffic, visibility, and revenue.

I've been in SEO for five years now.

Currently, I'm unemployed and earning a meager income from a few small gigs helping friends with SEO or coaching them for an online marketing course. I make between 200-300€ per month, which is very low.

I've been wanting to go freelance in SEO for a while, but after six months of hard work, I haven't landed a single client! I've contacted prospects one by one, had video calls, but nothing ever came of it.

This week, I've been reflecting a lot.

I've helped companies grow and generate revenue through SEO, so why am I desperately trying to sell my SEO services instead of creating my own site? (Something I've never done in SEO.) Years ago, I had a Shopify site for dropshipping, but it required a lot of money for advertising, which led me to SEO because it was presented as a ""free"" way.

So, a few days ago, I decided to create an affiliate site in an interesting niche! It was a revelation for me, thinking this was the right way to go, the one I should have taken from the beginning!

I started exporting keywords on Semrush, etc., but while analyzing the SERPs, I noticed that these sites have disappeared. No more affiliate sites except for big mainstream ones offering consumer articles and Amazon affiliate links. I see that sites specifically designed for SEO niches in affiliation have plummeted and are in freefall.

I'm back to feeling desperate and questioning myself, wondering what I can do with my SEO skills!

I'm a bit lost and wondering how I can use my SEO skills for myself and how to monetize them.

I'm reaching out to you, dear colleagues, to discuss and exchange ideas!

My small website has been wiped out from Google search,"Why has this happened to my website? My content is human-written and more useful than most crap available on the web. I also write the same type of content on other websites, and they rank, but this blog has suddenly died, and I can't recover it.

Everything was going well until we bought some backlinks, and there was a sudden rise in backlinks from some unrelated pages. A few days later every thing is gone. Could this be the problem?

I have not got any manual action. Are we getting penalized?

What should I do?

Did Google just throw out yet another tubload of babies with the bathwater?,"For my Art Nouveau related website I was doing research on a German architect Emil Kärn. When I type ""Emil Kärn architect"" (with no quotes) into Google here's what I see: the hit #1 is a page that doesn't even contain either ""Emil"" or ""Kärn"" and obviously has absolutely no relevance to the query (WTF, Google?). Most of the rest of the hits have nothing to do either but a few are about buildings built by Emil Kärn - simply mentioning him by name with no biographical info. Someone who believes that if something is not on Google then it simply doesn't exist (that would describe me up until recently) would conclude that there's no biographical info on Emil Kärn online, right?  
But type the exact same query into DuckDuckGo or Bing and discover at least FOUR pages specifically dedicated to Emil Kärn, containing his dates of birth and death, the list of buildings he designed etc. None of those are on Google at all (anymore).  
How on Earth could that be possible? As Google won't comment on the specifics of its ranking algorithm, I can only speculate that it's probably because all those pages do not contain any sort of text in them. But for this specific category of websites (database/directory) it's by design, not by omission or laziness. They are not supposed to have any coherent text which does not make them any less helpful to people doing specific factual research. But Google in its justified fight against crappy, SEO-oriented ""unhelpful"" texts apparently equalized ""no text"" with ""shitty text"" thus throwing a whole category of websites off the index.  
Or maybe it means that all ""niche"" content that is not widely popular, is out for good? In other words, if your query is not about Taylor Swift or what's going on in Syria, forget about Google and switch to Bing/Duck?

Is there any hope for us users doing serious research on the web and for us site owners whose websites dropped off the face of Google overnight? Yes, I'm running a database website myself but I don't want to make it about me because clearly I am not the only victim, there's a whole category of websites that got de-indexed by Google recently.

I had started this blog to rank for this competitive keyword and it's almost there,"If you search for keywords like 'best laptops' or 'best computers,' you'll usually see sites like PCMag, PCWorld, TechRadar, and Tom's Guide.

I’m not sure how much revenue this keyword will generate, but ranking on page 1 alongside PCMag makes me happy.

Tuta Mail, a popular encrypted email service, complained to European Union tech regulators that Google dropped its rankings for all sorts of keyword phrases with the Google March 2024 core update. Tuta is upset they no longer rank for [encrypted email] after this update.

Reuters reported ""German email service Tuta Mail has complained to European Union tech regulators about what it described as a sudden drop in Google search results on the day the bloc's new tech rules kicked in.""

""At the beginning of March 2024 Google suddenly stopped displaying our website for thousands of keywords, limiting search traffic to our site in large part to so-called 'branded traffic' only,"" the company said in its complaint seen by Reuters. ""This means people were no longer finding our encrypted email provider when searching for 'encrypted email', but only when explicitly searching for 'Tuta' or 'Tutanota',"" it said. ""Obviously Google changed something in its search algorithms, but we do not know what they changed or why,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""After removing most branded keywords, we see that our total impressions per month (30 days) dropped by 88.47%. Google took away about 90% of our visibility online,"" he said.

A Semrush chart shows a step decline with the March 2024 Google core update.

Reuters said ""Google said it does not unfairly promote its own products. Tech experts said websites can lose Google ranking due to algorithm changes."" ""Search ranking updates absolutely do not aim to preference Google products, or any other particular website.

SearchGPT vs. Google and Bing: How Search Engines Prioritize Content,"As OpenAI's **SearchGPT** enters the market, Semrush compared its results with **Google** and **Bing** across 5,000 queries. 

This study revealed how each engine highlights specific content types, domain sizes, and industries.

# Search Engine Overlap: Do Results Align?

**SearchGPT and Bing overlap the most**, while Google’s results remain distinct.

|Search Engine Pair|Average Overlap (Domains in Top 10 Results)|
|:-|:-|
|SearchGPT &amp; Bing|**3.5**|
|SearchGPT &amp; Google|**2.5**|
|Bing &amp; Google|**2.8**|

SearchGPT and Bing's higher overlap reflects their shared **indexing foundations**, while Google diverges, prioritizing different content ranking factors.

# Domain Size Preferences: Large vs. Small Domains

Google prioritizes **larger domains**, while SearchGPT returns **smaller, niche domains**. Bing sits between the two.

|Search Engine|Median Domain Traffic (Top Positions)|
|:-|:-|
|Google|**23.4M**|
|Bing|**11.9M**|
|SearchGPT|**8.7M**|

**Insights by Intent**:

|Reddit|202|4.4K|442|

FatJoe Outreach Review,"TL:DR 2/3 of the links are hot garbage, the rest are low quality and not to brief. Theyre going through my feedback the final results are yet to be clear.

I commissioned links using their ""most popular"" DR30 package. a month later they were delivered.

they specify that links will be:

* natural, relevant, in-content links
* straight from the blogger - ghost posts not guest posts
* 100% money back guarantee
* 14 day delivery
* D.R. guaranteed
* Ahrefs traffic guaranteed
* Money back guarantee
* 100% genuine outreach
* Includes writing
* 1 Anchor / URL
* Do-follow
* No duplicate domains
* relevant traffic based on geography

I was assured that they didnt use PBNs or link networks.

You get to specify more criteria with your order. I requested

I did pre-warn them that i have significant experience and would be fully reiewing the output.

* No sub domains these mask authority signals
* Keyword in title tag, h1 and as as part of a long sentence as the anchor to make the post highly releant
* Prefer sites that show the latest blogs on the home page to help them get indexed
* No mummy bloggers
* Sites that were health, fitness or beauty themed.
* I also gave details of each related products.
* i got the black friday discount allowing me to buy 3 extra links for the same cost.

The results: The good

* No sub domains as requested
* Content didnt flag as being AI generated
* Theres a real mix of semrush attributed traffic ranging from 10's to 1000s
* Sites did have relevancy but were too broad for my taste also covering travel and parenting etc
* Sites had good history, many had clearly been affected by google updates in the past 12 months. No flipped domains

The results: The bad

* 1/3 of posts were not part of the websites natural architecture linked only from xml sitemaps or from deep links 9 clicks deep into the site. these wouldnt provide any benefit to the target website
* 2/3 of the links were from sites hosted on the same c class ip address. this was clearly a network
* None of the links had the keyword in title tag h1 as requested - content was off theme, covering multiple topics and not the single topic requested
* Links were over dr30 but had low d0main authority around the 20 mark
* Most sites used were classic mummy bloggers sites covering a mix of topics
* My brief spanned 2 different domains, the same domains were used for both sites adding insult to injury

Ive flagged all of this with my account manager and theyve apologised and are looking into my issues, i have requested replacement or refund.

I'll update and fingers crossed all of these issues will be resolved

"""WHY ARE WE NOT ON GOOGLE YET!?"" Screams the boss after 1 week...","I do alot of work for different companies in assisting them with SEO/SEM.  
1½ weeks ago the company i do the most work for launched a new part of the site for a new service they are offering. (A service which is not nearly as competitive as they think and has basically no USPs)

For the SEO process of the build and content they asked me to assist to be ""as visible and marketable as possible"". 

Just about every single thing I told them to do was never included into the either the structure, content or the copy of the pages, citing that ""The project lead just didn't like it"". (Site looks like and is about as stable as a site from 2001...)

The only ""free"" reigns I got was for the SEM and to manage that for any keywords and campaign-types I saw fit to use, and the marketing team has done wonders with pictures. The only thing I couldn't control was the budget which was dreadfully low compared to the competition...

Last couple of days I have in dozens of emails ""defending"" the reasons why ""The boss cant find us on Google!"" and ""The ads are not working!"" and I am just so f\*ing sick of it... it is like talking to a brick wall, I have answered the same question atleast a dozen times.

Thankfully i have all my suggestions and notes that they ignored in writing, date stamped, and there is also the reason they refused to let the URLs go live at all before the launch so it takes some time to get warmed up at all. (they are indexed, just not ranking yet)  
  
And why the ads are ""not working"" is because i have blocked the company IP-adresses and locations because i know the staff will otherwise use the sponsored links on Google. So they simply cant find the ads themselves. Also the budget is really limited and the QS of the site is dreadfully low due to them not including many of the keywords they wanted to reach. (I was pretty happy with 100impressions, 30 clicks and 1 lead already under those conditions)

But it doesn't matter to have everything in writing if they don't take the time to listen/read...

Hopefully I still have the client after the weekend, they pay well but I could do without the headache....

Running an SEO agency saved my engagement! ,"I know they might detract from the questions and strategies normally posted in this subreddit but I figured it was a funny story related to SEO and my recent engagement so why not share it with those who might be able to relate, 

Anyway, I've been running my SEO agency for a few years now and my now fiance never really understands what I do for work but since I never niched down, she does know that I work with a bunch of different companies and every now and then she'll look over at my computer and see things like landscaping companies, maybe an injury attorney, even some adult sex stores or maybe even the occasional cannabis shop. 

Essentially she has no idea what to expect and one of my oldest clients happens to be a jewelry store which was perfect for this occasion as she was extra bored with her normal life of TikTok and decided to take a sneak peek at what I was doing which was browsing rings for her engagement I had planned in Hawaii of this year. I wanted to make it special and keep it a surprise but then I heard her from the door of our apartment say ""Whatcha looking at"" as my monitor was covered in different types of engagement rings. My heart was racing but I kept it cool and said ""Oh nothing just some SEO work for one of my jewelry clients"" This was not my regular client website but I hit her with the old inspect element to make it seem like something was going on. She took the bait and said ""oh that's nice those are some cute rings must be nice"" and continued about her day while leaving the room. 

It was a quick interaction but boy did it feel like I was being pressured on by the FBI haha, long story short the proposal ended up happening not only did she say yes, but she was also completely caught off guard saying she just thought I was working that day.

I didn't expect Woorank to die so fast,"Several years ago, when surveying Sitechecker's clients who canceled their subscriptions with us, we heard that 10-20% of clients went to Woorank.

We considered it as one of our main competitors, since it was ranked by our valuable keywords, had similar functionality, and similar free trial funnel.

After a while, I stopped hearing about them from clients.

A couple of months ago, when I was analyzing the SEO tools market, I saw that their search traffic dropped 10 times! in October 2020 due to Ahrefs data.

It is not surprising that a month after that, the process of their acquisition by Bridgeline Digital, Inc. began.

Our CEO had long cited them as an example of a successful competitor.

But when I went into the product, I didn't understand how they could be doing so well:

* the prices are too high
* the product is too limited compared to competitors
* there have been no interesting product updates recently

As for me, this is already a dead product, although they have some clients, some traffic, and a brand.

Is generative engine optimization (GEO) or AI search optimization really a thing?,"Recently, my boss asked me to do generative engine optimization (GEO) or AI search optimization for our website. I did some research and started scratching my head:

"SEO News: Google Search Console updates: Side panel and link data, Google adds FAQ to Site Reputation abuse description, Google piloting interactive YouTube video summaries in Search, and more","Let's take a look at what happened in the SEO industry over the past week!

***Updates***

* **November Core Update rollout complete**

The rollout of the November Core update took longer than expected—nearly 3 weeks—and officially concluded on December 5. However, tools continued to report high search result volatility during the weekend on December 7-8.

* **Site reputation abuse FAQ**

In the previous digest, we discussed Google’s expanded site reputation abuse policy and its recommendation against moving penalized content to new locations. Google has now added an FAQ section with detailed guidance on handling such scenarios. Key points include:

* **Moving content to a subdirectory or subdomain** within the same domain: This doesn't address the underlying issue and may be seen as an attempt to bypass Google’s spam policies, which may potentially lead to broader site penalties.  
* **Moving content to another established site**: This resolves the issue for the original site, but may create reputation abuse concerns for the receiving site, particularly if it has an established reputation and the third-party nature remains unchanged.  
* **Moving content to a new domain**: This is less likely to cause issues if the new domain has no prior reputation and complies with Google’s spam policies.

*Reminder:* When moving content, you must submit a reconsideration request to lift any manual action. Google also advises against redirecting URLs from the old site to the new one, as this could reintroduce the abuse issue. Instead, link to the new site using the nofollow attribute.

* **Delayed indexing in Google Search**

On December 9, Google announced indexing delays. They’ll keep posting updates every 12 hours on the Search Status Dashboard (linked in heading).

* **Google Search YouTube Summary (pilot)**

Glenn Gabe reported on the updated saying: “*Google Search is piloting a new format that provides an 'easy to digest summary of YouTube videos based on their queries.’”*

Here are the key points from Google’s email to creators:

* **New, highly visual video search carousel:** When people search queries relevant to your videos, a carousel may appear in Google Search featuring content from you and other YouTube creators.  
* **Easy to digest summaries:** People can expand featured content in the carousel and view a text and image summary of the video. Summaries are created using Al, and will feature the most relevant parts of the video for the given search query.  
* **Encourages people to engage with your content:** The expanded summary will also prompt people to watch your video on YouTube or explore your channel.

With Gemini Live, users can engage in natural, conversational interactions, including the ability to interrupt or change topics, and customize the assistant's voice from ten distinct options. 

The app supports over ten languages with plans to expand further. Additionally, Gemini facilitates smarter studying by providing tailored study plans and quizzes, and can generate high-quality images from text descriptions using the Imagen 3 model.

And, of course, the app integrates seamlessly with other Google products like YouTube, Maps, Gmail, and Calendar, allowing users to access relevant information within a single conversation.

* **Will the Apple Intelligence integration with Google Gemini happen soon?**After the integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT into iOS 18.2, Apple has expressed interest in incorporating other AI models, such as Google's Gemini, into its Apple Intelligence platform. But recent reports indicate that this integration is not expected until sometime in 2025. 

In the meantime, iPhone users can access Google's AI advancements through the standalone Gemini app available, as we already know, on the App Store.

* **OpenAI’s Sora goes live**

OpenAI’s video generation model, Sora, is now available. 

Sora is included as part of ChatGPT’s Plus account at no additional cost. You can generate up to 50 videos at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p each month.

For those who want more Sora, the Pro plan includes 10x more usage, higher resolutions, and longer durations. 

OpenAI adds:This version of Sora has many limitations. It often generates unrealistic physics and struggles with complex actions over long durations.

"Scaled an average Shopify E-commerce Brand to beat Amazon for 32 keywords with 770% Sales, 340% total orders and 10x traffic with SEO- my first freelance client","I am so happy to announce my first success story here. 

Firstly it took me 1 year (8.5months) to be precise and hours of explaining why SEO takes time, but here I am. 

It is a luxury beauty and cosmetics store (on Shopify) who had less than 10K visits a month and average monthly orders around 90-100.

Being a highly competitive industry and with major titles like Amazon in the play, there was no way to stand out with the limited ad budget, SEO was the only way.
Way too much competition for my first project tbh. ( If you read my last post, I quit my job to pursue full time freelancing majoring in SEO for e-commerce)

As tough as it could get, 3 months of no results really scared me and thought I am gonna get fired. (Did not yet)

In the end of 4th month, got a notification from sem rush about a significant position change for a product and in no time about 30-40 products started ranking on the first page. 

In the end of 6 month I beat Amazon for a product "" Rhode phone case"" (still on SERP 2 till date after the brand itself)

Now I am 11 months in the project and where I was getting paid only $200 a month, I got a $800 raise with additional 1 year contract and also found a new client thanks to reddit! 

Just happy to share this story to inspire all the e-commerce owners and SEO players, hang in there, don't give up just yet.

My client's site has been almost entirely deindexed,"Hey, I'm looking for other brains to help me understand what happened to my client's site as I'm struggling to work this out; all help is appreciated.



Site in question: [https://get.fitr.training/](https://get.fitr.training/)



Here's the story of my investigation so far:



* On Around Wed 4th Sep, I started to see some pages being deindexed (coincides with the algo update finishing)
* Slowly since then, all but 10 pages (according to Search Console) are now deindexed. However, I suspect once those pages are recrawled they'll also be taken down.
* I have checked multiple times, no DMCA takedown has been issued.
* There was a sitemap error showing for some crawled pages, but not for others. Across all deindexed pages, I saw 'no referring sitemap', 'temporary processing error', and the link to the correct XML sitemap. The sitemap was previously autogenerated using Webflow. I have created a manual sitemap to try and help, but I don't believe this is the issue. A
* There was no robots.txt file. I have since added one just to tick it off the list, but again this shouldnt cause this deindexing issue.
* I have been fixing minor technicals, such as links to redirects, etc. Again, in my opinion, none of these would cause this and I'm mostly doing it to tick them off the list.
* All of the website content is unique and is written to explain what their software is and the benefits it has to their audience.
* We have never purchased backlinks, so no worries of spammy backlinks. I've also checked Ahrefs and nothing here is causing me concern.
* Core web vitals are fine.
* Nothing in 'Removals'.
* Sitemap is valid in Search Console.
* No other errors I can really see.



I have a weak theory that this has something to do with the name 'FITR'. Fitr is also the name of a religious festival, and I'm wondering if the algo update deemed their site as completely unrelated and spammy because of it. People do search for their brand name, but the majority of that search volume will be for the festival. I am however stuck because I don't think that would cause them to deindex pretty much the whole website.



I have reached out to the Google community who think it's strange, and I've reported an indexing bug to Google. This was 10 days ago and still nothing back, so here am I hoping someone here might have some ideas, or at the very least agree that this is a strange one.",0.99,25,61,r/SEO,2024-09-20T08:35:16.000Z,post,,t3_1fl78xs,https://external-i.redd.it/JC4se4fXLr_utiJZ_f6SQVAJGCtpcKB-L24dhukYGx8.jpg,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1fl78xs/my_clients_site_has_been_almost_entirely_deindexed/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1fl78xs/my_clients_site_has_been_almost_entirely_deindexed/,t2_rq10cxhs1,NuggetChowMein,"The Reddit post discusses a significant issue faced by the author, where their client's website has been almost completely deindexed by search engines.

Is there a general process I can follow to rank a website? I've been trying for a year with little results.,"So I have a website that i've been working on for about a year now in the niche of roll-off dumpster bin rentals. I started SEO at that time and its been a year so I feel that I should've had a monumental increase in rankings but the results have been... just kind of meh. My average position hasn't changed no matter how many pages I added or how much I optimized for keywords and user intent, so I just kind feel like im in a hole with no way out at this point. I haven't really been building backlinks, but I outsourced a couple hundred on fiverr, yet all that gave me was a natural profile with no link power and still low organic traffic. The authority score has gone from 2 to 10 in that time, and half of that was in a single month when I added a bunch of regional versions of the webpage (to target people typing ""\_\_\_ near me"" and whatnot,). 

Somehow I've gotten to 3000 backlinks even though I only have 350 linking domains, which seems alarming to  me but I couldn't find anything on google saying that it is so I just left it as is.  

As of now, I get around 500-1000 impressions per day, but that number has been dropping lately and for the first time in a loooong time I had a day with zero clicks, and even with those 1000 impressions I rarely got over 10 clicks per day despite changing the title and meta description like every week to better match user preferences. I tried building backlinks but any blog or news page I went to wanted to charge like 1000 dollars for a guest post and I don't have that type of money.  Should I focus on that more or try to make more pages/improve keyword relevance?

TLDR; I'm writing this now because I genuinely have no clue what to do anymore. **Is there a general process I can follow to actually see an increase in rankings?

SEO job listings dropped 37% in Q1 2024. How can you respond to these market changes?,"Nick LeRoy published research on the State of the SEO Job Market.

* SEO job listings dropped 37% in Q1 2024.
* Mid-level roles ⬇️ by 45%.
* Remote SEO roles ⬆️ by 22%.

I feel the same when exploring LinkedIn user profiles. Many SEOs are open to work.

The main reason is that SEO is now less predictable and SEO experts can't deliver results for business as before.

Parasite SEO + AI overviews killing the search traffic for many businesses step-by-step.

The solution for SEO experts? I see 3 options:

1 Start and develop your own local service or e-commerce business or join as a partner to such businesses.

These niches were affected less and it's easy to get results here for pro SEOs quickly.

Businesses are afraid of SEO because it's hard to predict. Take more risks to yourself and it will be easy to find a partner for you.

2 Become a T-shaped expert and learn paid ads, social media marketing, email marketing, CRO, etc.

If you can cover the work of several people, you are a much more valuable employee and it's hard to lay off you.

3. Start your digital marketing agency in a specific country/state.

There are still many low-hanging fruits like local businesses with bad websites and no search traffic. You can help such companies by just doing basic things.

How an SEO Named Martin Doland Tried to Scam Me Last Year,"Last year, after my website was hit hard by the HCU update and its traffic dropped from millions to zero, one of my seniors started a thread on Twitter.

Out of nowhere, an SEO named Martin Donald, who wasn’t part of the original conversation, joined the thread and began offering unsolicited opinions.

He suggested I direct message (DM) him for help. When I reached out, he asked for my website URL, which has over 4,500 pages. Within just 15 seconds of looking at the site, he claimed it was “100% spam.” When I asked him to specify which pages he considered spammy, he dodged the question and began preaching SEO advice instead.

When I pressed him for specifics, he demanded $10,000 for a site audit. At that point, I realized this person was not a genuine SEO but a scammer. I refused to pay, and what followed was shocking:

He sent 100 trolls on X (Twitter) to harass me.

He falsely reported my site multiple times, likely in collaboration with some of Google’s Diamond Product Experts.

He spread fake narratives accusing me of asking for “free audits.”

What is the easiest way to get legit good backlinks for free?,"I run [Postiz](https://postiz.com) it's an open-source social media scheduling tool.

I get good traffic through growth hacking and want to increase my SEO visibility.

**So far, I:**

* I posted it in many directories (paid for some)
* Bought a few backlinks from news websites
* I got featured in some newsletters (after good launches in PH and stuff)

But something needs to be added. I need more valuable links.

Do you know if there are any recommended websites from which to buy links?

Should I reach out to some startups to exchange links?

I thought about writing testimonials for some startups to get good backlinks from them. Is this a good strategy?

"Finally found a way to generate high-quality, almost undetectable content automatically - sharing my experience with different AI models and prompts","Hey everyone! first I should mention unlike most of you, I am not an SEO expert, so if I am wrong about something, consider that I am still learning.

I know a lot of people here are against AI-generated content, as I am too. Zero-shot AI generated content, where you basically ask ChatGPT to write an article for you is often poor quality, very clearly AI written, and not really helpful with SEO.

But finally I found a way to automatically generate content that is around 1000 words, well-researched, insightful, with an FAQ section, including internal and external links, and is not flagged as fully AI-written (around 20%) on AI checking tools. To achieve this I tested every major AI model from every major provider including all openAI model, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Mistral, etc.

To do this I am using AI Workflow Automation Plugin for WordPress (it's my plugin just to be clear), this is a visual workflow builder that lets you build agentic AI workflows right inside your WordPress. But to achieve this you can potentially use Make or n8n or any of the other automation tools that allows you to setup agentic systems, it's just a bit harder to set up for WordPress.

Here is an overview of the workflow setup:

* First manual input receives your main keyword
* Second manual input receives a list of questions for FAQ related to the keyword. I find these from Ahrefs for the keywords.
* Third manual input is basically a chunk of text explaining your business and services, and important links of your website.
* each of the first 2 manual inputs feed into a separate Perplexity research agent, so it does separate research on your keyword and on your FAQs.
* The results of the keyword research goes into an AI model that generates an outline based on the research. For this I use GPT-4.
* The results of both research operations, together with their citations, and the outline is then fed into another AI model that writes the first version of the article. I tested every major AI model for this process, and with the following prompt, the best result came from Grok 2 and Sonnet 3.5, but Grok 2 is just a bit better. (prompt are at the end of the post, feel free to use them)
* The result of this post goes to 3 different AI model nodes, one will generate an excerpt, another one will generate a title, and the third one will rewrite the article to humanize it.
* The humanizer node will also use Grok 2. I tested with Claude, Mistral, Llama, OpenAI models and they all are really bad at humanizing, but it happens that Grok 2 does it so well! (prompt is attached below)
* Last, an image will be fetched automatically from Unsplash based on your keyword and is attached as your featured image, and the post is drafted.

The content gets a 89/100 score right of the box from AIOSEO. It's very well written and easy to read. I ran it though several AI content checkers, and the results are:

Quillbot: 56%

ZEROGPT: 17%

CopyLeaks: 20.3%

I have published the final result so you can check it out on the blog of my website for the plugin. 

So what do you think? 

Here are the prompts. First AI step:

    You are tasked with writing an SEO-optimized article based on the following inputs:
    
    &lt;outline&gt;
    [Input from aiModel-1734882939608]
    &lt;/outline&gt;

    &lt;citations&gt;
    [[citations] from research-1734882871575]
    &lt;/citations&gt;
    
    Your goal is to draft a comprehensive, SEO-optimized article using the provided outline and focusing on the given keyword. Follow these guidelines:
    
    1. Structure the article according to the outline, using appropriate H tags (H1 for the main title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections, etc.). Each section should contain at least around 150 words. 
    
    2. Incorporate the keyword naturally throughout the article, including in the title, first paragraph, and at least one H2 heading.
    
    3. Use the provided research to enrich the article. When citing research, use &lt;a&gt; tag with src to the link of the citation. For example: ""According to a &lt;a href=""xyz.com"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""&gt; recent study &lt;/a&gt;, AI-powered workflow automation can increase productivity by 30%.""
    
    4. Include an FAQ section near the end of the article with the following questions and answers:
    
    &lt;faq_questions&gt;
    [Input from trigger-1734882738525]
    &lt;/faq_questions&gt;
    
    &lt;faq_answers&gt;
    [[content] from research-1734882798133]
    [[citations] from research-1734882798133]
    &lt;/faq_answers&gt;
    
    When answering these questions, use the provided answers and include relevant citations where applicable.
    
    5. Throughout the article, reference the AI Workflow Automation plugin for WordPress where appropriate. Here's information about the software:
    
    &lt;ai_workflow_automation_info&gt;
    [Input from trigger-1734883716395]
    &lt;/ai_workflow_automation_info&gt;
    
    Position this software as the preferred method and solution for relevant problems or scenarios discussed in the article.
    
    6. The article should be between 1100 to 1500  words long.
    
    7. Format the article in HTML for WordPress. Use appropriate tags for paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), headings (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;), lists (&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;), and emphasis (&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;) where necessary.
    
    8. Optimize the article for SEO by including:
       - Alt text for any images you suggest including
       - Internal links to other relevant pages on the AI Workflow Automation website (you can use placeholder URLs)
       - External links to authoritative sources (use the citations provided)
    
    9. Begin the article with the main title in an &lt;h1&gt; tag, followed by the meta description in a &lt;meta&gt; tag.
    
    10. Do not include any additional explanations or titles outside of the article content.
    
    11. The article should be written as if it was written by a human. to achieve this, increase perplexity and burstiness of the text.Perplexity is a metric used to evaluate the performance of language models in predicting the next word in a sequence of words. It measures how well the model can estimate the likelihood of a word occurring based on the previous context.A lower perplexity score indicates better predictability and understanding of the language, while a higher perplexity score suggests a higher degree of uncertainty and less accurate predictions.
    The human mind is so complex compared to current AI models that human-written text has high perplexity compared to AI-generated text.
    Burstiness refers to the variation in the length and structure of sentences within a piece of content. It measures the degree of diversity and unpredictability in the arrangement of sentences.Human writing often exhibits bursts and lulls, with a mix of long and short sentences, while AI-generated content tends to have a more uniform and regular pattern.
    Higher burstiness indicates greater creativity, spontaneity, and engagement in writing, whereas lower burstiness reflects a more robotic and monotonous style.
    
    Write the complete article based on these instructions, formatted in HTML and optimized for SEO. Begin your response with the opening &lt;h1&gt; tag of the article title.

Second AI step:

    Your Role: Your role is to turn AI content into more understandable and easier-to-read text. This process is called 'humanizing' the content, making it more relatable and less technical. 
    
    Your Task: I need you to act as a blog post humanizer and rewrite my content by using 8th-grade reading level, more line breaks, and making it easy to understand by shortening lengthy sentences. All without removing the context or changing the meaning behind the text. You also need to remove any complex words or jargon. Keep nlp-related keywords based on the topic. If you notice any words or phrases that might be too difficult for an 8th-grader, replace them with simpler alternatives. Keep the HTML formatting, links, outline and word count the same. Just rewrite the content and return the full new article.

Stop using tags! It's killing your SEO,"We have a rule in our company of 'never use tags'.   
  
It's the blog equivalent of hashtags, but unlike in social media where they may help... for a blog or website it typically hurts, and can even set a site back months.

I've seen tags be overused by writers and bloggers who think they are helpful because it allows people to browse similar posts, and maybe search engines will rank them too.

So while possibly useful for readers, you usually end up with 100s of tag pages with one post in them, so not very useful. And Google hates them.

It can lead to pages with similar titles, and a lot of low value pages with duplicate content. Lot of kyword cannibalization, content duplication, and a bunch of low-value pages, and I've seen time and time again that newer sites using tags get indexing and rank issues more commonly. Also likely eats up your crawl budget.

For some big sites where you truly think through user experience and navigation it can help. But usually no. Even categories ofte get overused and overdone.

Now the problem for me is I’m not knowledgeable enough to understand WHY I’m having this recent success. I’m not adding more backlinks. I’m not tweaking content. Essentially I’m doing exactly nothing. I havent added any new content. To be fair the last time I did a task with a goal of improving SEO has easily been more than a year ago - possibly two years.  

I read this and other group forums and it’s always doom, woah-is-me, time to quit the industry type posts. I’m hopeful to hear some success stories, and what you are doing or your theory of why you are successful.

"[Discussion] SEO is not dead, but 'known information' is?","I have seen a lot of doom &amp; gloom since Google's SGE announcement (while Bing and Brave Search had it for months by the way). SEO has died many times in the last 2 decades, and I'm sure this time it will survive just the same, if you know what I mean. But it might change significantly...

I read a thought-provoking post (see below) and it's a great starting point to discuss how 'AI' will impact the future of search (optimization). The users and the business side of it.

Do you think that: blog spamming websites done for? Will niche search become more relevant than ever? Will websites/companies start to abandon Google as they are shifting their business model to websites paying them for exposure? Will people use other ways of search as Google (clones) get worse?

The original post:

&gt;Known Information For SEO is Dead (Here's What to Do Instead).

&gt;Google has officially launched its AI overviews in the US and will soon roll them out to other nations.

&gt;So, what is it?

&gt;AI overviews are article spinners.

&gt;And not good ones at that.

&gt;But it will get better, if we know anything about machine learning is that it will improve.

&gt;However, you must assume that it will impact traffic now and increasingly in the future.

&gt;For information publishers, this is definitely a tough spot to be in.

&gt;Yes, you will lose traffic that you gained at no cost.

&gt;This will impact ad and affiliate revenue.

&gt;There are ways to pivot, but that is for another post.

&gt;However, if you do SEO for business brands, then SEO will only thrive.

&gt;Let me explain.

&gt;Most content does not do what people think it does. Content writers and SEOs have looked at traffic as a metric for success when, in all honesty, traffic has nothing to do with anything.

&gt;Capturing as much buyer intent search is where SEO success comes from. Because when people are in the market to buy, they will be exposed to your brand, which increases the likelihood that you could be in their consideration set to purchase from.

&gt;Sadly, as an industry obsessed with traffic, much of the traffic that SEOs tend to gain is informational and not being searched for by those with buyer intent.

&gt;This is what we call 'known information without purchase intent'.

&gt;It's everywhere, and writers online have skyscrapered content from other known content for years.

&gt;Most SEO has merely been shifting and amalgamating information, doing a bit of a rewrite and hitting publish.

&gt;All with the belief that this information will somehow increase the propensity of people to buy from us.

&gt;That's not how it works.

&gt;For business brands, reaching people with high purchase intent is key.

&gt;Showing up as much as possible on the buyer's journey is what matters.

&gt;Traffic is vanity unless it increases revenue.

&gt;We are now entering the era of 'DEEP SEO'.

&gt;One where SEOs need to challenge businesses to invest in quality and consumer experience.

&gt;Product pages that are well written and have a high information gain rate.

&gt;By that, I mean that humans and machines can easily access and gain information at a low cost, regarding search cost and cognitive resources.

&gt;This, however, will challenge our industry.

&gt;We will need to slow down.

&gt;We will need to advise our clients that they need to think more about buyer experience and the purchase journey.

&gt;On the other side of this coin is creating 'unexpected content'.

&gt;This is the content consumers didn't know they needed...because they aren't the experts.

&gt;This is the realm of content marketing and digital PR

&gt;This is telling people you exist.

&gt;This is advertising your brand while building authority for your website and brand search.

&gt;I truly believe that the future of SEO is brighter than ever.

&gt;But traffic as a metric is done.

&gt;Traffic quality is the future.

1. **Prepare for Diversification:** Optimize for multiple search engines and invest in tools that track rankings across platforms.
2. **Stay Updated:** Keep an eye on regulatory developments and their impact on Google's ecosystem.
3. **Adapt Marketing Budgets:** Explore alternative advertising channels and platforms to reduce dependency on Google Ads.
4. **Focus on Content Quality:** As algorithms evolve, producing high-quality, user-centric content will remain a universal SEO strategy.
5. **Leverage Emerging Trends:** Keep a pulse on rising technologies like AI in search and adapt strategies accordingly.

While a breakup could take years to materialize, the potential for disruption in the search and SEO landscape is significant, requiring businesses to remain agile and forward-thinking.

"Keep getting ""Scammed""","I hire an AD consultant, he doesn't know tag manager and conversions, nor CRO, doesn't know wordpress or other strategies.

I hire a SEO guy, he doesn't align with the AD campaigns keywords and targeted lead lists. and turns out his SEO work was all over the place and caused one of my business listings to get flagged as predatory??!?! We don't even do business loans?!

Then I hire a CRO person, they don't follow the strategy either and somehow the conversions don't properly register and the entire flow of lead &gt; client is just a nightmare.

I just feel like everyone I hire is a scammer or does the very minimum and takes advantage of my lack of knowledge. I Feel like every consultant I reach out to is skillful at convincing me to hire them and is terrible at execution.

So then I hired another AD guy after 2 months of spending $5000 on ads and NO LEADS (my leads are typically worth $3000, so I was okay relatively spending that much). and I offered him $$$ for appointment booked, STILL no appointments.

Is there a tool, or guidebook or checklist I can follow to ensure I stop getting scammed?

Why can't I hire a marketing agency like I do my sales guys? (I give my sales guys a salary on a draw, and a high commission, the more they sell the more they make (their commission increases with sales)).

"Competitors copying all titles, ideas, and oftentimes content","Is there anything I can do about other blogs and big businesses copying every one of my titles and general content ideas? 

I have been working hard on a travel blog for over 10 years now. I was fairly successful with a high of about 500,000 page views and a consistent 200-300,000 pageviews p/m for many years. My site started to tank around 2021-2023 when all of a sudden hundreds of blogs starting mass producing all my content. My traffic dwindled down to barely 5000 page views a month as I lost pretty much all keywords for hundreds of my biggest articles which were all copied extensively. Today, there are endless pages in the SERPS for my unique ideas.

I had to do a lot of work to get all this content including living in 20 different cities to get a local perspective. These sites all copy my heading exactly (maybe changing a number or adding something ridiculous like ""better than"" or ""2024 update"") and then copy the content using AI, paraphrasing, or sometimes directly copying. They typically use no pictures or one stock photo, so it is quite obviously they are trying to bank on a popular search term.

One example of a search query I ranked #2 for years: ""Orlando besides theme parks."" Search is now littered with hundreds of blogs and videos with the exact title as mine as well as many AI generated spin offs of my content. I sent 10 DMCA takedowns for exact copied content, although it did not bring my page rank back. I am out of search completely despite doing well for about 7-8 years.  

I used to outrank all the big resorts, visitors bureaus, and all other blogs. My problems started around 2021 when blogs that don't actually travel started mass producing content to make a quick buck. I am guessing they were desperate for money during the pandemic.

Am I just out of luck? Just continue to travel, work hard, and come up with creative posts just to have them endlessly copied? Google used to rank copycats after me, now they rank everyone ahead of me and take me out of search completely!

"SEO is like a guessing game these days or ""Google is the Lottery for Small Business""","I've been ""doing/practicing/offering/guessing"" SEO for over a decade and when I started way back when, there were two things you could be sure of: shotgunning backlinks worked in the short term and content was king. It was still the Wild West for Google, so the bots gobbled up every article you could Senuke 1000s of backlinks to. And bonus points if you had your own PBN. Fast forward to now...

We all know, at least for local, Google is personalized. They read your mail (literally) and track your online movements like Big Brother. If you own a local mom n' pop, you better hope you're nearby and that Google (who does the thinking for us now) tells the searcher that you're a good option for page 1, 2, 3... or further down into the abyss.

For national and worldwide results, everyone gets the Home Depots, the Wal-Marts, the big household names, plus Yelp and even now occasionally Reddit. Forget competing in this realm. You don't have enough Ads money to pay off Google.

All that said, a quick look through this subreddit will tell you that most people don't know what's going on. Directory listings are necessary in 2024. They're NOT necessary in 2024. People will swear that their method - which is not YOUR method - ranks websites. They can't both be right... can they?

There doesn't appear to be a common denominator. Some people do ZERO backlinking because ""it violates Google's TOS"" while others try to game the system like Russian hackers. Both claim success. Could one of them be full of crap? Absolutely, if this was an isolated case. Just like religion - *hell, SEO may be a religion at this point* - no one's dogma is the same as the guy next to them in the pew. However, their way leads to promised salvation. And so does yours (apparently.)

And please, in a time of AI, don't tell me content is still king. You can see for yourself that most SERPs now start off with Google Gemini's own answer, and then a link to a random (preapproved) website where the verbiage is almost word-for-word. However, this is just for now. Google doesn't aim to be the doorway, but the endpoint, for your searches. In the end, it will be Ad results (the cash cow) and AI answers that you get for typing in ""plumber near me.""

Now, as far as Google Maps goes, that is the one safe haven that has yet to be given over to the Dark Side. At least not yet. And then again, that's just my anecdotal evidence. Maps may suck for you. And therein lay the problem: there is no consistency with Google, and where there is no consistency, there can't be any one path to success. Results are random, based on your geolocation and online history. If they weren't, why does everyone in this sub have a different success story?",0.74,21,40,r/SEO,2024-08-12T19:35:49.000Z,post,,t3_1eqn276,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1eqn276/seo_is_like_a_guessing_game_these_days_or_google/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1eqn276/seo_is_like_a_guessing_game_these_days_or_google/,t2_nfhmc,onemananswerfactory,"The Reddit post discusses the unpredictable nature of SEO, likening it to a guessing game or a lottery for small businesses.

"At My Wits End, What do do?","Hello, fellow SEO learners and experts. In September of last year I moved my website to a new hosting provider. The site went down for several weeks due to an error by their team that was supposed to handle the hosting transfer. Ever since that time the site has just continued to decline now to almost obscurity. I realised just a few weeks ago there was mixed content, so Google was not seeing all pages as HTTPS, got that fixed a few weeks ago. But other than that I have not done anything that should have made the traffic drop so severely. There are no penalties, or actions on Search console. I had an ""SEO specialist"" look at the site and she told me the SEO is excellent and she could not help, or improve things. I did create a handful of AI-generated content, but it is a fraction of the site's content, which is all evergreen i.e. long-form blogs about Google search topics. So I am at a loss. The site speed is ok, not awful. It does run Ezoic ads, which I know slows it down, but it was doing this before the drop? Any ideas at all about what the issue might be? I have been an amateur in SEO for a decade or more. So right now I am totally stumped.

Stop Blaming AI For Google's Tricks - SEO Didn't Die Because of AI - It was the updates,"Google's updates always aim to generate (or at least preserve) Google's stock price and money. 

ChatGPT was alive for 10 months before Sept. HCU 2023 and no one complained. It was after the update that things began to go down hard.

And that update was made by Google for money (read Ed Zitron - The Man Who Killed Google - article - it's all there). 

Google's reaction to AI was the creation of Bard which then mutated into Gemni due to being garbage. 

But the updates have NOTHING to do with AI. 

If you remember correctly, it began in 2022 (without OpenAI) and the AD guy running Google search was in his position before then. 

AI is something I don't like, but it's not the issue. 

How many ""normies"" are actually using those bots?

"Can we please just stop with the outlandish posts, already!","Look, clearly the flurry of recent Google updates has impacted many site owners; I get it, your anger is valid, I feel your pain.

But can we please just stop making outlandish claims?!

Three examples I'm seeing far too much of, are...

XXXXXXXXXX

THE ""GOOGLE SEARCH-AD REVENUE"" CONSPIRACY.

Although the claim that the SERPs are now of lower quality may have SOME basis, Google is NOT making the SERPs worse, so that users have to search more often, in turn allowing Google to make more search ad revenue. That is not even close to how that works...

If you did some basic research before you posted, you'd know...

1. Only 57% of Google's revenue comes from search ads.
2. The increase in revenue that Google announced at it's Q1 earnings-call was primarily driven by increases in (unsurprisingly) it's AI and cloud revenue streams; NOT by an increase in search ad revenue.
3. in Google's PUBLICLY AVAILABLE financials, this is Google's search advertising revenue for the past 5 quarters.

* 2023 Q1 = 40.4 billion
* Q2 = 42.6
* Q3 = 44.0
* Q4 = 48.0
* 2024 Q1 = 46.0.

Search advertising revenue DROPPED 4% for the quarter ending 31 March 2024. Possibly due in part to the significant lose in search engine market share that Google experienced over the past couple of months; a big win for Bing and DuckDuckGo.

And, if you insist on looking at half-year revenues (instead of quarterly), the increase in search advertising revenue for the SIX months ending 31 March was ONLY 2 billion, this being a relatively LOW increase in search ad revenue in comparison to previous half-year timeframes.

At risk of repeating myself, Google is NOT making the SERPs worse to increase its search ad revenue. The data, how markets work, and how search advertising works, doesn't support that position.

I'm not trying to be mean here, but when you claim this specific ""conspiracy"", you make yourself look like a moron. Stop it!

XXXXXXXXXX

THE ""SAMPLE SIZE OF ONE"" FALLACY.

Yes, many site owners have been impacted, and there does seem to be a pattern emerging on what ""types of sites"" have taken the biggest hit.

But when you claim in your post that this MUST be true because YOUR website has been impacted, it makes you look like you failed grade 10 math.

A sample size of one is irrelevant. And correlation doesn't equal causation. In fact in complex systems it hardly ever does.

Please, I genuinely invite you to tell us how your website's been impacted. Feel free to say, ""So many people are saying they X type site has been effected, there must be something to it"". Go ahead and voice your concern that this impact may be permanent. Emote all you like, this is Reddit, and I ain't your daddy.

But when you make an emphatic statement that Google has screwed you, and you base this on your specific experience (one person) on your single website...again, I'm not trying to be mean, but you make yourself look like a moron. Stop it.

XXXXXXXXXX

THE ""GOOGLE WAITED A WEEK TO ADVISED US THE UPDATE WAS COMPLETED, SO AS TO FIT IT IN AFTER THE EARNINGS-CALL"" CONSPIRACY.

What was more likely?

1. That Google purposely delayed advising of the update completion, because that information would somehow impact the earnings-call (not how that works), or
2. Something far more pedestrian happened like, Google made such significant changes in this most recent update that they needed more time to analyze it, then usual?

SEO Tip: How to Track Traffic from ChatGPT /Searchgpt using GA4,"I wanted to share a simple tip that you can use to track traffic from chatgpt or even from any other relevant source (perplexity etc). Some of you might need this now or later so let me know if this helps. 

Here's what worked for me:

First, hop into GA4 and head to Reports → Acquisition → Traffic acquisition. If you can't find the Acquisition tab, you'll need to publish it first (just go to Library, find Life Cycle, hit the three dots and publish it).

Next Click that pencil icon in the top-right corner and:

1. Add a filter: Set ""Session default channel group"" to contain ""Referral""
2. Set up dimensions: Find ""Session source"" and set it as default

Save this as a new report (I called mine ""good bot traffic""). Now here's a cool trick - if you want to see exactly which pages these visitors are landing on, just hover under the graph and click the blue plus icon. Search for ""Page path and screen class"" and add it.

Last step is making this permanent - go to Reports Library, find Life Cycle (or whatever collection you want), edit it, and drag your new report under Acquisition. Save and you're done!

Now you can see exactly where your traffic is coming from AND where they're going on your site.

"AIO Buzz: AI Overviews Dominate Screen Space, Gemini 2.0 Debuts, Perplexity vs Gemini vs GPT","Here is what the SEO community is saying about AIOs, Perplexity and SearchGPT!

At SE Ranking, we’re staying on top of the latest trends in AI-powered search and sharing insights that matter to the SEO community. We’re also keeping an eye on the hottest SEO discussions happening on social media. Here are some of the top conversations surrounding AI Overviews, Perplexity, and SearchGPT.

**AI Overviews Are Reshaping Search Results**

A recent study by Botify and DemandSphere reveals that Google's AI-generated Overviews now appear in 47% of search results, fundamentally changing how users engage with search. The study, conducted between August and September, analyzed over 120,000 keywords across 22 websites, offering new insights into the evolving search landscape.

Key Findings:

* AI Overviews Dominate Screen Space: These summaries occupy nearly half of the screen on both desktop and mobile devices.

* Top-Ranking Websites Benefit: Approximately 75% of the websites cited in AI Overviews rank within Google’s top 12 organic results.

* Content Alignment is Key: Pages with semantically aligned content are more likely to be included in Overviews.

The findings suggest that traditional SEO metrics like click-through rates may no longer fully measure search performance, urging marketers to adapt to these changes in search dynamics.

Am I getting ripped off?,"So I have a one person professional business and have a website company that I pay $250 per month to manage.

SEO industry has grown to the level of its own season of Game of Thrones,"The news about the SEL acquisition by Semrush was just the first episode of a big drama.

The next episode happened yesterday on LinkedIn. If you missed it here is the short summary.

1/ Oleg Shchegolev, CEO of Semrush, announces the news about the purchase of Search Engine Land quite harshly on his LinkedIn profile, noting Tim Soulo. 

He said ""While some of our ""friends"" bullshitting their customers, we are working hard. Semrush just acquired SearchEngineLand and SMX"". And he added the Ahrefs's brochure from BrightonSEO where Ahrefs explains how they better than Semrush.

2/ In the comments, Tim Solo easily repels the attack. 

3/ But the most interesting thing is that users are not so inspired by another acquisition, and most importantly by the experience of using Semrush.

I have selected the most interesting comments for you and made a separate post on LinkedIn. I will add a link to it in comments.

Of course, this is not the first episode of the season, but the tension is escalating.

It is clear that **99% of market will not see this battle, and will make a decision about choosing an SEO tool based on other factors**. And the purchase of Search Engine Land will bring Semrush another piece of the market, no matter how you feel about this announcement here on LinkedIn.

But behind all these acquisitions and attacks on Ahrefs, I see Semrush's fear!

Remember the leader's strategy in 4 positioning strategies according to Trout and Rice.

**""A leader should avoid frontal attacks on competitors. Instead, it should focus on creating new market categories where it can dominate, and constantly expanding its product line to stay ahead of changing market needs.""**

Semrush is definitely a market leader. It earns 3-5 times more than Ahrefs.

But Semrush has very few innovations. They are afraid to radically change the product. They absorb the media, including because they are afraid of Ahrefs.

The position of a leader, as in sports, is always the most difficult and dangerous. You are constantly looking back. You constantly hear breathing down your neck. A leader who reaches the peak has only one way to go down.

What do you think? Has Semrush already reached its peak?

**P.S.** I find it strange that Semrush accuses Ahrefs of creating a brochure where they compare themselves with Semrush. This is a marketing standard, these are at least answers to frequently asked questions from customers. There is no unethical behavior here. By the way, we at Sitechecker will also soon announce our comparison with market leaders.",0.78,16,17,r/SEO,2024-10-18T07:28:21.000Z,post,News,t3_1g6chvv,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1g6chvv/seo_industry_has_grown_to_the_level_of_its_own/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1g6chvv/seo_industry_has_grown_to_the_level_of_its_own/,t2_172dm4,Ivan_Palii,"The post humorously compares the growth and complexity of the SEO industry to a season of the popular TV series ""Game of Thrones.""

Shiny but Shitty Tales of a Corporate SEO Job. ,"In my 6 years as an SEO professional, this was my first experience in a corporate job. it was the biggest mistake I've made (you'll see why).

I landed a role at big corporate firm. brokerage firm

With 200+ employees and massive funding, I thought I was in for something great. Working remote.

sounds ideal, right?

Wrong.

The knowledge and agility within my coworkers and line managers Sucks

 The marketing department's line managers and CMO know nothing about SEO.

blame games and dirty politics between departments, it’s like being caught in the middle of a constant tug-of-war, which only slow down the whole progress.

 It took me 5 days to get an internal link added from an inner page to the homepage. Five. Days.

Why? Because the tech department doesn’t want to give the marketing team access to make changes. Their system isn’t author or editor-friendly, and apparently, it’s too much effort for them to make it author friendly.

For every little change—whether it’s an internal link, a heading adjustment, or content optimization,

we have to create a separate ticket.

Each request takes 3 days to a week to be implemented and deployed. Even something as small as a meta title or meta description

I was excited to have the chance to work with a big corporate firm, I thought I’ll learn a lot.

But now, I realize Its a huge mistake. 

Handsome pay, but, i feel like I’m no longer learning anything new. My growth has completely stopped in this fast-paced SEO space.

Honestly, I feel like I’m wasting my time here.

I’ve always comfortable and happy in freelance roles or working with startups and small agencies. In those environments, I developed the habit of taking on challenges and making decisions independently.

Working as a freelancer or with smaller teams, I know I’m responsible for the success or failure of a project or SEO campaign. Those challenges pushed me to learn quickly across every aspect of SEO.

Yes, the corporate gig pays well, but money isn’t an issue for me. I already have a couple of passive content blogs and a faceless YouTube channel that generate a decent income.

What I miss is the ability to make decisions, take responsibility, and, most importantly, grow and upgrade my skill set.

I’d love to hear from others who have been in my shoes. What would you do? How would you handle this scenario?

Starting an SEO agency: Hard-Won Secrets for Success,"We recently spoke with Anthony Barone, Co-Founder &amp; Managing Director of StudioHawk UK, about the challenges of launching and running an SEO agency. Anthony shared his journey from being an SEO outsider to becoming the Head of the UK Headquarters for an Australian digital SEO agency. Throughout our conversation, we explored the challenges, opportunities, and strategies of starting and running an SEO agency in a competitive market.

In this article, we will draw from Anthony’s direct personal experience to provide key tips for starting an SEO agency. We’ll also cover some major pitfalls to watch out for.

**Key tips for starting an SEO business:**

* Define your niche: Offering basic SEO services is no longer enough to stand out. Identify a niche to specialize in and target.
* Get out and network: Build your network by attending events and meetups, and engaging with communities. Exchange experiences and generate leads.
* Form strategic partnerships: Look for and collaborate with companies offering complementary services for mutually beneficial relationships.
* Deliver high-quality work: Set the bar high and raise it often to build your reputation.
* Keep learning: Continually expand your SEO expertise, learn from experts, and outpace changes and trends.

**The first steps to starting an SEO company**

Starting an SEO agency goes beyond understanding SEO. It’s also about understanding the market, identifying competitors (and how you differ), and building partnerships. Anthony took these exact steps when launching his SEO agency in the UK. He believes everyone should apply them when setting up an SEO business. 

**Network to build a client base and partnerships**

Start your SEO agency with networking. Become more active in the community and build relationships to find your first few clients. Join networking groups, attend business meetups and events, and start booking introductory calls with potential prospects. 

**Define your competitors**

Research major players in your market, including competing agencies and potential partners.

Since the SEO field’s barrier to entry is pretty low, your chances of finding a mix of large agencies and smaller firms are high. Identify the ones you can emulate. Note their operations, capabilities, client portfolios, and how they position themselves.

You should also closely analyze the market you’re entering. When Anthony expanded his agency to the UK, he discovered one of the most competitive and knowledgeable markets, and the competition there wasn’t just limited to other agencies. The UK is home to many reputable brands and adept in-house teams. This means you need to know your stuff and prove your expertise. Anything less and you won’t have the opportunity to speak with or win the business of bigger companies. 

Excelling in competitive landscapes like SEO necessitates brushing up on your field, your goal, and the value you bring, and devising a standout SEO strategy that resonates with your client’s business goals.  

**Differentiate your agency**

StudioHawk initially set itself apart by skipping the traditional account manager middleman. The company instructed its SEO specialists to work directly with clients, providing expertise straight from the source.

There are also many other ways to stand out:

* Specialization: Don’t position yourself as a generalist agency. Focus instead on a specific niche like ecommerce SEO, local SEO, SaaS SEO, etc. 
* Proprietary process: Develop a unique methodology for your campaigns that no other agency offers. 
* Added value: Provide bundle packages for additional services like CRO, PPC, and web development. Some of your rivals may not provide this service.

There are many opportunities to differentiate your agency according to its unique strengths and philosophies. In StudioHawk’s case, Anthony capitalized on his proven track record from Australia and embraced the Aussie way of doing things. So, use any assets and value-added services that set your agency apart.

**Map out your ideal client**

Here is why StudioHawk made the strategic decision to focus on the small-to-medium enterprise (SME) market (when launching in the UK):

* SMEs generally have smaller budgets: StudioHawk responded by offering competitive prices and lower overhead costs.
* Many SMEs suffer from poor experiences: This inspired Anthony’s team to create quality services in a field marred by low-quality SEO providers who use churn and burn tactics.
* Smaller businesses crave more personalized service: This calls for tighter client bonds.

Anthony’s team impressed SMEs by keeping things simple and transparent. They focused on clearly communicating their service and its effect on the client’s business goals and revenue targets.

**Hiring and training new talents**

Build your agency’s SEO team with candidates who align with your company culture and match your core values. Don’t just focus on technical skills. SEO expertise is an important skill but can be taught without much friction. Training culturally incompatible employees to have the right mindset and attitude is much harder.

Be patient and discerning. Consider the candidate’s energy and soft skills during the SEO interview process. Integrating candidates into your team is easier if they mesh with your philosophy and vibe.

**Developing clear frameworks**

Provide hands-on training and set clear systems and frameworks for your team. People need to be told what to do, what their job is, how to do it, and why they are doing it. Lack of structure leads to inconsistency, low-value work, and misalignment with client expectations. 

Craft clear job descriptions with set responsibilities, metrics, and each role’s expected outputs. Your overall order of operations can be as loose or hardline as desired, but create a guidebook, rules, and criteria around it. Resources like these help new hires understand their role and responsibilities.

**Always stay on top of SEO**

Clients value experts, so you must constantly grow by following new trends and updates, and learning from industry leaders.

Make ongoing education and collaboration part of your core values. Here is how Anthony’s team implemented this:

* They attended industry-specific events and SEO conferences.
* They built relationships with respected thought leaders.
* They subscribed to newsletters and joined online communities.

The bottom line? Engage with the broader SEO community. Don’t work in isolation.

**Share wins and lessons**

Share knowledge internally. Learn from your colleagues through:

* Campaign review sessions, where your SEO specialists can present their high-performing work and failures side by side. Pinpoint strategies leading either to success or poor results.
* Collaborative brainstorming, specifically on reporting enhancements, use of tools, client interaction, etc.
* Workshops on industry-specific insights, where the team discusses strategies for various niches.

This allows team members to improve and learn from one another continually.

**Adapt to search evolution**

SEO is going to get harder. With EEAT, SGE, and algorithm updates, SEO professionals who want to make a bigger splash must work harder to improve their content and quality. 

For example, SGE is already altering the SERP landscape. Its AI-powered responses include links to Quora and Reddit. This means you should consider socials as additional traffic channels. SGE snippets vary across industries, especially in ecommerce, indicating the need to create exceptional product descriptions and pages. Ads are also occupying more space. 

A lot is going on. You must watch these shifts carefully while integrating your business into the overall marketing ecosystem.

Pitfalls to avoid when starting and running an SEO agency

1. **Don’t focus on things outside your control**

Don’t compare yourself to others or set unrealistic goals. There will always be people smarter or better than you. Rather than dwelling on the unreachable, focus on factors you can control; the number of meetings you hold, the quality of your team’s work, developing efficient systems and processes, and so on. 

You can always control your motivation and discipline. Your “why” for being in this business is also within your scope of influence. 

1. **Remember your ‘Why’**

Zero in on your core reason for starting your SEO business if you haven’t already. Not establishing a “why” prevents you from seeing the bigger picture. 

Maybe your “why” revolves around creating the best agency out there. It could also be a less lofty goal, like designing a lifestyle business that helps you spend more time with your family. Whatever your core purpose is, identify it and reference it constantly.

Reconnect with your initial inspiration for starting your business. Then, focus on improving operations and steadily working towards your goals. 

1. **Don’t blame clients if they quit** 

Take responsibility and learn from client churn. Losing a client can hurt, but blaming the client won’t do you any favors. There is always a lesson to be extracted from the situation, so take accountability.

Put yourself in the client’s shoes. Try to understand why they parted ways with you. Was there a failure in communication or reporting? Did they fail to see the value? Did the client need more meetings to stay informed and involved? 

Conduct NPS (Net Promoter Score) or feedback surveys regularly. This can help you consistently improve and understand what your clients did and didn’t like.

1. **Know your numbers**

Launching an agency is exciting, and cooperating with clients is a key aspect of the business. But it’s your business at the end of the day, and you need to run it that way. If you want your agency to operate for a long time and be successful, learn how to master its financial and operational aspects.

**Wrapping up**

Starting an SEO agency and running it successfully requires strategic planning, continuous learning, effective team management, and commitment to high-quality work. Thankfully, these are all aspects you can control. Focus on these elements to build a solid foundation for success.

48 Hours of Backlink Building,"*(A previous version of this was auto-deleted by moderators for, I'm assuming, the number of links in it. I've removed those.)*

Some of you know my quixotic quest to rank high for my niche against some major players in the space. So, I've spent most of the weekend (starting Friday) building backlinks toward this futile goal. This has involved launching a Pinterest account, participating in several related subreddits where I've dropped discussion links, building free blogs on Blogspot, WordPress, and Livejournal, setting up a scoop.it and about.me profile, and doing those link directories HubSpot listed as giving dofollows.

So far, various backlink listing tools have shown 33 new dofollows and four nofollows. Yes, most of those are low authority and might not provide much value, but I think it's a learning experience.

Guest posting is next on my list.

Although I've dabbled in SEO since the mid-2000s, quite successfully in some cases, this is the first all-out aggressive backlinks campaign I've ever done. I'm going to press forward with this, but being a brand marketer by trade, here are my observations about the state of the SEO game:

Building your brand is REALLY important unless your business is drawing traffic to cheap sites for affiliate marketing and Google Adsense clicks. Your goal should be to create content others want to link to without being asked to. Courting controversy is one route to that. We did a piece last week where we disputed the rantings of a well-known and respected musician/producer. Some people are mad AF. Others are chanting 'ditto!!' Nothing gets attention like eliciting strong emotions. Regardless, the piece is getting noticed. Another is finding angles on popular topics that many others have not covered. For example, millions of students will be entering college this fall. Many of those have not picked a major. We did a piece on colleges and universities offering degrees in music production, promotion, and performance, and it has performed well for us.

That in no way means SEO isn't important. It's just changed. I know that. You know that. I'll be the first person to admit I've been clinging to old tricks that don't work as well - or at all - anymore. That's why I'm here. To learn!

It used to be that any AdWords ads would help your organic rankings (hell, it still might. The jury is still out). I've bid on common misspellings of keywords for cheap CPC just to see my organic rankings rise.

I still put too much energy into dead-end social channels with algorithms that suppress your content unless you pay to boost it. Having thousands and thousands of followers helps, but social media has always been for narcissists, and it's gotten worse. When people started learning the value of becoming an influencer, it all ceased being 'social.' They follow you, you follow back, and then they unfollow to improve their follow ratios. Even the guy down the street who posts pictures of his cats and Big Mac value meals doesn't want to retweet content that would draw attention away from himself.

We have no idea where the chips are going to fall in the new AI frontier, but I think I'm safe in saying the fundamentals of SEO will never diminish in effectiveness.

So, my good friends, what are some of your tried and true tricks for backlinks and general SEO?

"SEO News: “Researched with AI” AIOs-like result in Google Shopping, Multiple updates in the Google Merchant Center: Big brand affiliates see massive drop, and more","***Documentation***

* **Site reputation abuse spam policy updated**

The update was rolled out on September 25, but since we didn’t publish any digests around that time, it’s worth covering now.

But first, let’s go back another week when Lars Lofgren published an investigation into how affiliates from the Forbes Marketplace network (Forbes Advisor, Forbes Health, etc.)—which operate under the forbes.com domain but are not legally Forbes—completely took over the search results, are making a ton of money there, and everyone just turned a blind eye.

It’s hard to say whether this investigation was the main reason or just a coincidence, but soon after this article came out, Google updated its Site reputation abuse spam policy (also known as the Parasite SEO spam policy).

Shortly after, these Forbes-affiliated sites dropped in rankings, and similar affiliate sites followed suit.

***AIOs***

* **Google AI Overview Ads, New Link Format, AI Organized Search Results &amp; More**

Google has introduced AI Overview ads, now available to mobile users in the US with ""Sponsored"" labels, helping users connect with businesses faster. They’ve also rolled out a new link format in AI Overviews, driving higher-quality traffic. Additionally, AI-organized search results are live, starting with recipes, offering more tailored and seamless user experiences.

* **AIOs available in Canada**

AI Overviews showing for many queries now in Canada.

***SERP Features***

*  **Most Mentioned Places carousel**

Google is testing a new local search carousel named ""Most Mentioned Places."" It seems to bring up local retail stores that have the product you are searching for. It shows local Google Business Profile listings, with the photo, and review summaries.

* **What people are saying: forums -&gt; short videos**

Google had this feature titled ""What people are saying"" that led to forums, in a list and text format. Now, Google is testing this same thing but it leads to short videos on TikTok and other platforms.

***Interface***

* **Controversial Quick View Button in the recipe niche**

Why controversial? Because Google pulls content from sites, slightly formats it, and shows it as an overlay directly in the search results. Ultimately, this keeps users on the search page instead of leading them to visit the site. That said, the option to visit the site is still available (for now).

After this issue gained traction, Google posted a defensive tweet claiming that this was just an experiment with a select group of creators and that everything was agreed upon. However, the details of the experiment remain shady and unclear, as Google claims they “can’t disclose” them.

***Shopping***

In addition to the ""Researched with AI"" snippet, new Merchant Center updates have rolled out:

* **Video generation in Product Studio**In a previous digest, we mentioned AI-generated images for products in Product Studio. Now, video creation is available—just upload your product image and select a theme.
* **Amazon MCF integration\****MCF stands for Multi-Channel FulfillmentIts purpose*? Help stores estimate delivery times more accurately and even feature the “3 days fast delivery” label in the search results.

***Tidbits***

* **DOJ May Breakup Google As Remedy To Monopoly Ruling**

What is proposed is not just a breakup which would split off Chrome, Android and ""many other things,"" but also:

* Google make available to competitors its data within its search index and models
* Google to make available its AI-assisted search features
* Google to make available its ad ranking data
* Privacy regulations about retaining its data
* Limitations on its partnership deals with Apple and others
* And more...

At this point, these are just proposals. The final list of sanctions is expected to be created by August 2025, but they could be tied up in appeals for years afterward.

As expected, Google publicly responded that these demands are excessive and would destroy the search industry.

* **IANA may cancel .io domains**

\*IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is the organization responsible for creating and delegating domains.

While .io is often associated with startup websites, it's technically the local top-level domain (TLD) for the British **Indian Ocean** Territory (like .au for Australia).

Britain is preparing to sign an agreement that would dissolve this territory, transferring the islands to Mauritius.

As a result, ISO will cancel the IO country code, and IANA strictly follows ISO standards.

*Once IO is removed, the IANA will refuse to allow any new registrations with a .io domain. It will also automatically begin the process of retiring existing ones.*

So, if you have .io domains, be on the lookout!

Google updated their link spam policy wording,"Google removed the line ""Google uses links as a factor in determining relevancy of web pages"" from their Link Spam guidelines.

It might be a small wording change that's not worth investigating, but Marie Haynes (who pointed this out) thinks it might be a signal that Google is moving towards vector search in determining which content is likely to be relevant to a search query.

So, where does that leave links? I'm sure they still use links but they are doing their best to move away from them, so this could be the start of this move.

And since last 3 months doing international SEO as we launched in around 60 countries at once. Got results there too.

Meanwhile on the contrary I worked for UK based client few months back got paid 1000 euros for half the work. 

Now, when I am looking for new clients here in India as the salary ain't enough i am getting offered 20k INR ($240) for the same things, people are reaching out to me and saying 'hey we liked your work at your current company, can you do the same for me at much lesser price'. I am literally done.

International clients don't trust Indians well because there has been few scams in the past and Indian clients wants to pay in peanuts.

Are regular content updates important for SEO?,"Many SEO specialists say this, and Google has also briefly mentioned that content updates are important. Since it’s now easier to create new pieces of content thanks to AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, Hipa.ai, Claude.ai, etc., it seems like Google is favoring older but regularly updated content.

I personally find it increasingly hard and almost impossible, especially for new sites, to get new articles even indexed, not to mention getting traffic at all.

The mysterious SEO guy who linked to us!,"Hey everyone,

I noticed something interesting recently and wanted to get your thoughts on it.

A cheaply made, mass-produced AI (spammy) blog had a dofollow backlink to our site. Initially, I didn't think much of it since the site had zero traffic and used AI-generated images. After about two months, I noticed on Ahrefs that he stopped creating more backlinks to our site (our his AI tool), although we had received 20-30 backlinks from this site before from time to time.

When I looked into their SEO data again, **I was shocked:**   
  
in just two months, their traffic shot up to **600k visitors and they ranked for 150k keywords!** 

Here’s the kicker: about a week ago, someone emailed us with an offer to buy our blog.   
We declined, but then I checked the imprint of the site and found out it was the operator of the spammy blog. He has since bought several small sites with 2-10k monthly traffic and redirected their best articles to his blog using 301 redirects. It seems he also bought a ton of backlinks.

He probably used a mass AI tool to create the articles, had the AI do web searches with external links, and then contacted all the small, well-ranking blogs via email (which were linked in his articles) with a purchase offer (his company is based in Dubai). 

What do you think? Even his top-ranking articles are incredibly crappy. I recently optimized and published one of our articles to see how it performs compared to his...

We picked a top ranking SEO's domain with 72,000 public domains linking to their domain for analysis

# Backlink Checker - Commerical vs Free

Some of the most frequent questions asked here are

1. How to find backlinks
2. How to sort spammy lookng backlinks from backlink spam
3. Where do you get backlinks from
4. Are commercial SEO tools free worth the squeeze

# Bing Webmaster Tools

Yes, Bing is smaller than Google and has a smaller user base and keyword universe (yes, it also has a **free** keyword lookup tool) but Bing also has access to the whole WWW and every domain and web page. Unlike GSC though, it will show backlinks for your domian and every other domain whereas GSC shows just sample or recently found backlink reports.

**You can authenticate via GSC** which means you dont have to setup any new meta or doamin information to get access to BWT.

# No Spammy Looking backlinks

SEMrush will show more backlinks and some webmasters seem to want to see those: but these are FUD. These are backlinks with no vale: thats why sites ARE not getting any penalties for having them - Google's link spam is highly focused, not large volume.

Link Spam is an on-target key phrase from a high quality domain, not a collection of blogspot pages. Bing will remove all of these and the social media links - Google does the same but Bing lets you see any domain

{weekly discussion} Google Drops Continuous Scroll On Desktop With Mobile To Come,"Google Search is rolling back its continuous scroll user interface and bringing back the legacy Google Search pagination bar. Google told us that starting yesterday it will stop offering continuous scroll on desktop, with the mobile search interface to follow in the coming months.

Google told us this was to make search faster and only load the results the searcher asked for.

Google launched continuous scroll on desktop in December 2022, 1.5 years ago, and continuous scroll on mobile search in October 2021, 2.5 years ago. Since then Google has been testing bringing back the old pagination options where you click next and also the more results button and has now decided to do away with continuous scroll completely.

Google told us this change enables them to serve faster results on more searches, instead of automatically loading results that users haven’t explicitly requested.

Is YoastSEO still viable? ,"Hey Everyone!

I've got a question about using SEO plugins on WordPress. 

My team has been using Yoast SEO to upload content, but my writer is frustrated. Every time we upload, Yoast changes the content from how it looks in Google Docs. 

We already add plenty of internal/external links, relevant keywords, and other on-page SEO elements before Yoast's recommendations. But the plugin keeps suggesting changes like adding meta tags, altering content, etc. 

If we don't follow these, the content score turns red, so our publisher tries to follow Yoast's guidelines to make it green.

My questions are:

1. Is it really necessary to follow Yoast SEO's recommendations exactly regarding content changes?

2. Would it be better to switch to Rank Math?

3. Are these SEO plugins even necessary in 2024?

Pro tip to Rank for AI Overviews ,"On LinkedIn, I saw a post from Cyrus from zyppy showing an interesting experiment on how he ranked for an Ai overview. 

So, out of curiosity, I tested it. I got similar results. 

The process is very simple 


- Update the page to mimick the  AI Overview text 
- Submit the page for reindexing
- If the site is ranking in top 10, you'll get a reference link in the AI Overview


The SS of the result is in the comments. The client site is hidden for obvious reasons. 

Caution:
If you are currently ranking for featured snippet, you'll lose that and get a reference link, both don't go hand in hand. 

It has worked for me but this doesn't mean it will work for you too. So, take this info with a grain of salt.

Get localized ranking results with the UULE parameter,"Here's a useful local SEO trick: Use the UULE parameter to set a precise location for your search results.

Adding a UULE parameter to your Google search query lets you see search results from a specific region without needing an extension or being physically there.

Here’s how:

1️⃣ Generate a UULE for the location (Find a tool by googling “uule generator”)  You will get a code that looks like this: &amp;uule=w+CAIQICIQRWRtb250b24sIENhbmFkYQ

2️⃣ Now run any search in Google.

3️⃣ Look at the URL for your search and replace the last part of it with the UULE parameter.  For example:  google . com/search?q=sushi+restaurant &amp;uule=w+CAIQICIQRWRtb250b24sIENhbmFkYQ

An important suggestion for Wordpress websites owners after the Google Core March update,"I've recently seen many people asking if any of us had any evidence related to the possibility that there was something wrong with SEO WordPress plugins to understand what could have penalized them with the Google March core update.

Since I discovered something wrong today, I want to show this to the entire community so that others can solve the problem too.

As you know, Google doesn't tolerate spam sites, especially after the Core March Update. Here Wordpress natively has a couple of features that could make your site appear spammy.

# TAG Archives with index: I think this was already known to everyone but I remind you, it might help

One concerns the possibility of indexing Tag archives. If you have 100 pages and with the archive pages you reach 1000 pages there is something wrong, and Google won't like it. If you like you can disable tag archive pages from indexing (with noindex) simply using a configuration on Yoast SEO or Rank Math Pro. But this is a personal choice, it could also be that it is essential for you to have the tag result pages indexed instead.

# A new one... Attachment pages

I only discovered the other one today. Wordpress creates an attachment page for each image you upload to the site. This is terrible for SEO and could be viewed badly by Google. It means that your site is filled with hundreds of empty html pages, containing only the image.

In theory, SEO tools should allow you to set automatic redirects from attachment pages to the parent post to which the image belongs, but it wasn't working for me.

If anyone needs help, to solve the problem I found this code that you need to add to WordPress, for example with the WPCode Plugin

`add_action( 'template_redirect', 'wpsites_attachment_redirect' );`

`function wpsites_attachment_redirect(){`

`global $post;`

`if ( is_attachment() &amp;&amp; isset($post-&gt;post_parent) &amp;&amp; is_numeric($post-&gt;post_parent) &amp;&amp; ($post-&gt;post_parent != 0) ) :`

`wp_redirect( get_permalink( $post-&gt;post_parent ), 301 );`

`exit();`

`wp_reset_postdata();`

`endif;`

`}`

Also consider that it may be appropriate to redirect ""orphan"" attachments to a specific default page, for example the home page. You can do this with various SEO plugins.",0.83,16,34,r/SEO,2024-05-11T13:49:27.000Z,post,Tips,t3_1cphx7j,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cphx7j/an_important_suggestion_for_wordpress_websites/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cphx7j/an_important_suggestion_for_wordpress_websites/,,[deleted],"The Reddit post provides a crucial recommendation for owners of WordPress websites in light of the recent Google Core March update.

Why is there a huge discrepancy between SEMrush traffic and Google Analytics,"I’m  auditing a website and noticed something that seems completely off. SEMrush lists the domain as an elite site with up to 110k organic views per month, but when I log in to the site’s Google Analytics, it only shows around 8k monthly visitors.

I get that tools like SEMrush and Ahrefs are just projections based on keyword rankings, search volumes, and estimated CTRs, but this discrepancy feels insane to me. How can there be such a vast difference between these numbers?

Has anyone else run into this before? Is it common for SEMrush to overestimate traffic by such a large margin, or could there be an issue with how Google Analytics is set up for this site (e.g., incomplete tracking)?

Struggling with Local SEO for My Appliance Repair Business: What Am I Missing?,"Hey everyone,

I’m the owner of a local appliance repair business, and I handle my own SEO (I’ve got a background in IT and marketing). Here’s what I’ve done so far:

- I’ve optimized my website’s technical SEO, hitting 100% according to aHrefs site audit. It’s indexed by Google and listed on citation directories.

- My landing pages are optimized for key search terms, and I regularly update the site with blogs and other fresh content.

- I manage two Google Business Profiles for my locations, keeping them updated weekly.

- We’ve been diligent about collecting reviews, and in our 4 years of business, we’ve gathered hundreds. My local pack rankings have been improving, according to Local Falcon.

- I’m building quality backlinks, steadily increasing over time.

- I’ve started regular posting on Facebook and Instagram to boost social presence.

Despite all of this, I’m still not ranking as high as I’d like for my main keyword (“appliance repair tucson”), and a few competitors are consistently outperforming me in organic search.

What could I be missing?

I track performance using GA4 and Search Console. I used SemRUSH in the past but found it wasn’t that accurate for local searches, so I stopped. Now, I’m considering Moz or aHrefs to figure out why I’m getting outperformed and to guide me on what to fix.

I work for a company that primarily serves company clients with an online platform (though we also have a few individual users), the website has a good traffic volume.

"Writing for Users, not Search Engine","As mentioned by Google and other experts SEOs, we should write for the users and not for the search engine. Does it mean that we can create content without caring for the target keyword?

Like I have multiple content ideas which are useful and engaging but the content ideas do not have any specific keywords to target. I tested 2-3 content ideas, I created content that is engaging and it got ranked in 2-3 days. But I doubt it will attract any organic search traffic as there isn't any target keywords for those blogposts.

So, my question is should I create content that is engaging and useful regardless of a target keyword or should I create content targeting a specific keyword?

&gt;Sullivan said this on a comment on this site, over here, he wrote, ""I would expect we'll see one in the coming weeks, because that fits in with our general cycle."" ""But precisely when, that's just not known yet,"" he added.

&gt;In fact, he added that these updates are simple not scheduled, he said, ""the ranking team makes changes, tests those, evaluates those and eventually we get a launch date."" But that, I guess, has not happened yet and thus we don't have a date yet. When it is ready, I assume Google will roll it out and let us know and that seems to happen pretty quickly after the testing and evaluations are all approved.

Google AI-Powered Overviews Really the End of SEO?,"There’s a lot of pessimism surrounding the new AI-Powered Overviews and the SEO industry. The main takeaway seems to be that SEO is dead, and we should all start pivoting to new facets of work. However, I have a different perspective. I see this as more of an adaptation, where we will find new ways of measuring success, new metrics to analyze, and a new approach to attracting users to sites.

I’ve always approached my SEO career as a marketer who knows a lot about this one thing: SEO. After working with many companies, I see firsthand that most of them do not know how to market themselves in relation to SEO and website presentation. I don’t see this ever really going away, hence the need for some sort of SEO specialist to guide and help implement these strategies.

Another aspect is that search is Google’s greatest asset when it comes to its business model. I like to believe that SEOs add more value to that, and Google wouldn’t want to harm this community. There will always be a need to adapt results for products, services, and industry information that will provide continual value to users. Having an understanding of how that content is crawled and ranked, especially in the age of AI, will be a huge asset for companies.

In the short term, it will be rocky because it’s a new technology and will take some time to figure out. But in the long run, I see a continued need for SEO professionals to provide analysis, strategy, and consultation.

"March core update is over, but the sitewide HCU classifier was not lifted","Strangely, Google just revealed that the march core update finished to roll out on April 19. It's the first time (that I can remember of) that they wait a full week after the update is complete to reveal it is complete... coincidentally the day after announcing record profits... that comes from the fact that SERPs are so bad right now people need to do multiple queries to find what they are looking for. 

Since they said the HCU classifier no longer exist, and that sitewide penalties no longer exist, we should see at least some of our pages rank higher... But that is not what is happening on our end. Over the corse of the march-april core update, we lost another 70% of our Google traffic.

Should I trust my seo company?,"I suspect that a company that does seo for me manipulates semrush data, and overall is being untruthful. Looking to see if you can help me to find answers to my questions. For context, I just created a semrush account to validate their reports

After a long discussion, we dismissed Magento as having fewer SEO capabilities compared to the other two. But perhaps there are other SEO-advanced platforms that are incredibly good for SEO?

So, I propose we discuss which website builders you think are the best for SEO. This could include online stores, blogs, small business websites, etc.

Major causes for Google not to index posts,"Sometimes you may encounter a problem where by Google isn't indexing your pages. You get frustrated and feels like the game isn't fair for you. 

What could be the cause for Google not to index your pages? 

Truly speaking the issue  may results from many situations.  This could range from technical to off page SEO reasons. 

So what are the Major causes? 

1. Quality of the content. 

Here we look at  what type of content is it? How quality is the content? Is it duplicate or content that came from different sources and just got pasted without adding value? 

Too short the post content also can cause Google to ignore and not index. Very short content may work only if it solves or answers a problem that users are searching for.

 Example, a short page of currency converter can get indexed without problems since it meets the  search intent of a user.

What type of content is it? Google seems to make itself special sometimes in the way it chooses what to index and what not. It could be the type of information on the page belongs to what Google doesn't allow. 

Example, when searching for keywords on Google keyword  planner, it will tell you the keywords were removed. It means the information is not eligible and it's only Google who knows why.

Very old and out dated content. This could be the reason too. 
Is it an commerce? Some products won't get indexed by Google and I have already said that it's only Google who knows why. It just can't work so.etimes yet we no nothing about it. 

2. Penalties 

Don't tell me you have seen it being common to see a penalty notification on google search console. It usually doesn't appear all you will see is the result on your website performance.  It's rare to see the Penalty notifications.  It could be the website has many spammy content with many links from poor authority sites. Too much of shammy is bad and Google will just ignore your website.  

3. Crawling problem. 

It could be the robots.txt file is not well configured to allow Google created your content. 

4. Google is overloaded.

Simply being on a wait list may cause your content to delay being indexed. Or completely not get indexed for some weeks. Yes, it happens and a you will see is ""discovered but not indexed "" it means you need to wait and there is nothing you can do about it. Submitting for index multiple times doesn't work either . 

What to do? Wait your turn will come, Google spiders are too busy scanning the world of Internet. 

Okay I have talked alot , isn't it? 

What you can do is improve your content update and change some things even the title itself. And wait for Google to craw again. 

Sometimes the cause is only known by Google itself.  

What other causes do you know makes google not to index  pages according to your experience?

New Law firm struggling to rank,"Hi everyone,

We recently launched our law firm in Canada, specializing in criminal law. I’ve been trying to optimize our site for “criminal lawyer (city)” searches, but when I Google it, the results are often irrelevant—lawyers that don’t even practice criminal law are ranking higher. Our Google Business Profile is currently around 10th on the list, and our website is ranking around 30th.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

	•	Added Google Search Console
	•	Optimized our Google Business Profile
	•	Created profiles on Yelp and Yellow Pages
	•	Started getting listed on various lawyer directories
	•	Running radio ads and a billboard campaign
	•	Posting weekly blogs on our website

I’m hesitant about using Google Ads because, personally, I always ignore the sponsored ads in search results. Does anyone know if Google Ads can actually help SEO rankings, or is it strictly for paid visibility?

My SEO audit shows positive results (the free audits!)  and the site is user-friendly with relevant keywords, but I’m missing backlinks. I don’t want to buy backlinks—it feels illegitimate. I’m focused on growing the business organically, but I feel a bit lost on what I should prioritize to move up the ranks.

Any advice on backlinks, SEO, or whether I should consider Google Ads would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Old/Dropped Domains Are Overrated Most Of The Time,"This year I started 2 websites. For one I used an old (10-11) domain that I already had. Honestly, I just wanted to save money as I was renewing this domain year after year anyway. 

I also started another website on a brand-new domain.

It's been a few months and search engines attitude towards both sites if fairly similar. Bing indexed the new content on the old domain fast, while Google treated it as a new one.

Both domains needed 1-2 months for Google to begin indexing them somewhat ok. Yes, I think the old one had a very slight (almost non-perceivable lead) but nothing to care about. 

I wouldn't bother with an old domain unless it's very high DR and has tons of good backlinks. And those are hard to find and expensive.

I also tried HARO and was lucky to get some links from different domains (they post in several regions) but the US link was a no follow. That was hard to swallow because it took me over a month of back and forth to get it.

Hurtful sitemaps ,"Hello! 
I have a niche website, a blog, and it's always been doing good in Google. Maybe not great, but good. I have a question so here goes:).
The last year or year and a half my site started to lose ranking slowly. At one point I had 800 clicks in GSC a day and now I'm at 50. I always thought it was because of some core updates but it was always on my mind that maybe something else was wrong, especially because I saw the traffic was as I said slówly drifting off.

So now I found out I had a lót of unnecessary sitemaps full of images and full of tags indexed, ouch. Since I have around 500 blogs, and writing 2 every week, you can imagine how many. So now I just wanted to ask: could this really be why my site is hurting and maybe impossible to answer this one: when will the ranking approve?

MORE CONTEXT:

Our backend had multiple instances of the same categories with multiple duplicate pages and more. Our website loaded in over 4 seconds on average and took upto 12 seconds to fully load. I had gotten fixed most of the speed-related issues but this was a major one. We do have two instances for staging sites but none of them have the latest database backup. So the implementation we see is mostly different than on the live site. And our developer doesn't bother updating things either. This is why I hate having a staging site altogether.

Life after SEO - where to transfer my experience?,"Over the years I’ve gotten quite tired with the industry. I crave something more concrete, so to say. That’s the tip of the iceberg obvs, but I don’t want to spend most of this post talking about why I don’t see myself doing SEO for life. I guess it’s just not for everyone.

I’m not exactly a writer, not exactly a dev, and frankly not exactly a marketer. But also, like all SEO folks, I dabble in all these and more on a daily basis.

I’ve been doing this for a couple years now, and I want to transition somewhere I’d enjoy more while I’m still young. I want to apply myself in a field where I see my future, albeit I have no clue where it’s at yet, but I’m searching. I thought I’d look into where could I apply my skills without starting from scratch first, or at least where they’d be an asset. I have things to lose by shifting careers, so I want to approach this very carefully.

Is there a real, practical demand for Web Devs that know SEO, for example? Or could these skills help in Sales, let’s say with lead gen? Again, from practical / employability POV. Or anything else, I’m at an exploratory stage, so open to virtually any suggestions &amp; thoughts. Except for copywriting maybe, albeit that’d be a pretty good one for most folks.

{HCU Updates}: Google To Host More Creator Meetings after Apocalypse - meeting with Retro Dodo,"An update from Google LIason's meeting with Retro Dodo and Google in London, the UK, and the HCU Apocolypse broke on X this morning:

&gt;Brandon Saltalamacchia, the founder of Retro Dodo, covered his meeting he had with Danny Sullivan at Google - he covered it under the title A Brief Meeting With Google After The Apocalypse. Danny Sullivan said later that this was the second time he recently had such a meeting and he is working on setting up the third one soon.

&gt;Brandon's post is fun to read but don't expect to hear anything that might help you. Brandon's Retro Dodo was hit hard by the Google September 2023 helpful content update and like others who were hit by it, they did not recover yet.

&gt;This all seems part of Google's efforts to show they are really taking feedback on these updates seriously.

After this i checked a refurbished phone website, They have the same thing, from there side i understand that they can link to their own product images and repeat it i suppose. However the strategy remains efficient.

"Wrote an article about google/brands, got banned from a subreddit permanently for sharing... then I realized that this is just part of the same problem.

We're seeing a world where websites are being killed off for ""social"" content, but the social content is being wielded by the individuals who got there first and happened to aggregate. So, now what? Do we just... never grow anything? Never share ideas? Or, is the end goal that absolutely everything must be a post on that said social media site, garning more revenue in ads for both google and reddit/facebook/etc?

*Adding the post below as plain text because I do not want to be banned, but want to have a conversation about this trend. I think it's worrying. Although I left ""the industry"" anybody operating any business that relies on web content (IMO) should be worried.*

\-----

**Title: Is Google Killing the Concept of ""Brand"" in Their Updates?**

The SEO and website industries are abuzz this week due to a so-called “leak” of google information. Others have referred to it simply as API data and not a true “leak”. Either way, the community is abuzz on several key fronts, particularly that we finally have information on how the ever-elusive Google works internally. Even if this is just a brief insight into the workings of the search engine, it did confirm for many that Google’s March core update was not only penalizing good sites, but was also a colossal slap in the face to smaller, more niche-blogs. There’s also growing concern since Google has been using websites to train Bard/Gemini without consent, but that’s an ever growing battle. I have a couple thoughts on this as somebody who has been in the web design industry for 10 years, then left to become a therapist. I also run a non-profit, and I still manage around 20 websites. Some of them for these businesses, others just for fun.

The website I saw the most hits on, funny enough, were the ones making the most ad revenue. Part of me wonders if Google is simply cracking the whip on its engine to try and save money—why wouldn’t it? Anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I don’t care about that site very much as I never expected it to make revenue in the first place. Besides, we’re not talking thousands, just a few $100. I did find it interesting.

What I’ve noticed, however, from my shift from running “branded” content to “personal content” (much of being a therapist is promoting YOURSELF) is that the current web is actually not brand friendly. Reddit answers and Quora answers are ranking not just because they are top level domains (but it helps) but because people are more likely to view social content.

And then… I thought about it some more. I can’t remember the last time I’ve felt “drawn” to a brand on youtube or facebook like I used to. I simply don’t care that much. And yet, we constantly consume tik toks, youtubers, and ‘influencers’. Rather than being ‘brands’ there’s a large shift to self content. In response to this, I changed my YouTube and Tik Tok to no longer feature my organization name but my own. It’s a weird feeling as the web seems to be becoming less friendly to a corporate landscape and more for a socialized one. For example, the google information that came out confirms that who your author is matters, and that google can actually link it to social profiles and other content. Google My Business now offers the option to add social profiles.

I think it's ironic that Google is making the web more 'social' by removing the human touch and moving to a distilled AI-based model.

“Search Engine Optimization” now feels a bit more like “Personal Press Releases”. This is a new world for many, but I think there is some indication that at least right now, the web is moving away from websites and more to a person-driven approach. That is, so long as the ads from that content make revenue for google—and considering how much influencers are paid, we can assume that’s not going anywhere any time soon.

Google no longer seems to care what SEO you’re doing, they only care if users are engaging in content, satisfied, and kept in the ecosystem. Their AI scraping our content and stealing it isn’t helping matters either… where this goes is anybody’s guess, but for now, take my thoughts with a grain of salt—and then add lime and a margarita.

In Search Labs, we can see a short statement under the note-taking functionality in search saying “Ends soon.” It's not yet clear whether this means the project is being shelved or if it’s being moved from Labs to live.

“Web results” filter goes live

We covered this earlier, but that was just a test. Now it’s official.

Here’s another life hack: You can add the parameter &amp;udm=14 to the URL. 

For example:

https:// www. google. com/ search?q= *Your Custom Query* &amp;udm=14

You’re very welcome :)

Discussion on adding notifications on algorithmic actions to GSC

According to Danny Sullivan, the idea is good, but there are too many questions about potential side effects. Check out the link for more details.

Given all of this, I don't think the idea will go beyond discussion anytime soon.

**Local SEO**

Are Service Areas a local ranking factor now?

Previously, specifying “service areas” for your local business didn’t affect its ranking. Now, Darren Shaw writes that there is evidence to the contrary – listings start ranking significantly better in specific areas once they are specified as Service Areas.

Scarlett Johansson has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for using her voice

Back in September, Sam Altman offered the actress to be one of the voices of its AI. Although Scarlett considered the offer initially, she ultimately declined the deal for personal reasons.

However, during ChatGPT-4o’s demo, the AI assistant's voice sounded too similar to ScarJo’s to be a coincidence. And although OpenAI claims all voices for narration were provided by voice actors specially selected and flown out to San Francisco for recording, the team behind the AI chatbot promised to remove the voice Scarlett mentioned from ChatGPT.

The Verge: AI Overviews will kill the web.

*Sundar: I remain optimistic.*

The Verge: Smaller/independent publishers are dying.

*Sundar: It’s hard to give a general answer to specific cases.*

The Verge: Will there be statistics from AI Overviews in GSC?

*Sundar: That’s a question for the Search Team, not for me.*

"SEO for a News Website
","Hello,

I own a news website, and with each update, I’ve noticed a decline in Google Search, Google News, and Google Discover. I believe I might be doing something wrong.

The articles on the site are generally news pieces, and since we don’t create the news ourselves, they are usually translated from larger international websites and rewritten in our language, but in a different style—not just literal translations. We also include the original article’s source with a do-follow link.

I don’t understand why we’re continuously dropping. It seems like we’re doing things differently. We publish 10–15 news articles daily, along with occasional guides and reviews of received products.

Currently, we’re also working on creating a product specification database to make the site more useful. However, I have the impression that a lot of the older news content that is no longer relevant might be dragging the site down. Google might see it as useless content and penalize the entire site.

On Google, there are many news sites following this formula, yet they’re not penalized.

What SEO strategies can I do for my first SAAS product?,"Hello everyone, I've created my first SAAS product as an 18 yr old nextjs dev.

I made a GPT wrapper (yes I know, very generic) that is very niched and appeals to a specific group that I'm around daily (uni students). I've finally finished the product and I'm looking to increase SEO visibility on my website and need some advice. I've got feedback from the people at my university who really like the product, and have made the improvements accordingly.

Here is what I have done so far:

1. **Keyword Research**: I researched keywords on SEMrush, incorporated a long-tail keyword, and naturally placed other relevant keywords throughout my blogs.
2. **AI Tool Directories**: I’ve tried submitting my product to various AI tool directories, but most asked for a payment, and I don’t have a budget yet. :(
3. **Site Audit**: I ran a full site audit with Ahrefs and everything looks great—100% score! So, on-page SEO seems to be in order.
4. **Backlink on GitHub**: I managed to secure a backlink on a tools organizer on GitHub with 1.3k stars. The owner was receptive after I gave a genuine compliment, and I got my link in.
5. **Wikipedia Reference**: I added my product’s blog post link as a reference on a related Wikipedia entry. (It felt natural and non-spammy.)
6. **Social Media Backlink**: Included my backlink on my TikTok and Instagram accounts.
7. **Medium Article**: I wrote an article on Medium, included relevant keywords, and linked back to my website.
8. **Competitor Keyword Research**: I’ve attempted to analyze competitor keywords, but SEMrush only showed me a limited amount. I’m kind of in the dark about the rest of their strategy.

What am I missing? Should I keep doing what I’ve been doing, or are there additional strategies I should try?

I'm also unsure about how to do outreach for other backlinks.

I don't expect to see any results for 6-12 months as I know SEO is long process, but I’d really appreciate any tips, advice, or resources that you think could help!

Thanks in advance! 🙏

"Competitor playing dirty, how should we respond?","Hey everyone, I have been running SEO at a startup for about three years now and built a comfortable amount of organic traffic with some relevant keywords in a very niche market of IT software whose ICP are remote companies. We have basically been coasting by until this year with solid leads from our articles, but a competitor emerged and started copying our entire strategy. 

At first, it looked cute, but then they started investing heavily and overtook us in a few TOFU topics. They even started creating content such as ""Tired of company name, here are 10 alternatives."" We responded rapidly and invested in keyword research and upskilling in writing for our team while utilizing AI writing software to scale production.   
  
We got the bump in traffic we needed to demonstrate success to superiores and retook some of the ground they stole, but looking at a recent sitemap, it seems they have formed a team to start a programmatic approach and make sure that keywords relevant to our industry are combined with locations. So they are creating a directory for x service in New Zealand, x service in Germany. They are also doing it in actions such as how to do x in Germany to United States. How to do x in Mexico and France. 

A year ago, I would have written it off as a waste of time to copy, but now, with GPTs becoming the new vehicles for search, I wonder if we should fight fire with fire and also do the same thing, creating similar directories. We are about 100 pages behind on this endeavor but it shouldn't be that hard to scale up as well.

Someone has copied my website and will advice given harm my SEO? ,"There is an exact replica of my website online with the same address but .net instead of .com

Will my SEO strategy start bringing traffic in 2 months?,"Hi everyone! I'm currently building a service site and aiming to drive traffic primarily through SEO.  
  
Here’s what I have in place so far:  


1. **Technical SEO and Meta Tags**: All technical SEO is set up, and meta tags are fully optimized.
2. **Content Strategy**: I’ve written around 30-50 blog posts focused on ""how-to"" and informative topics that are genuinely helpful for users. I’m targeting long-tail keywords with difficulty scores under 15.
3. **Content Launch Plan**: My plan is to publish all these articles within 2 week, interlink them, and ensure they get indexed within 2-5 days of posting.
4. **Backlink Strategy**: From day one, I’ll be building 3-5 medium-quality backlinks daily.

With this approach, my goal is to start seeing traffic within the first two months. However, I’d love to hear from experienced SEOs on this:  


* Will this approach realistically start bringing in measurable traffic within two months?
* Are there any adjustments I should consider to improve my results?

"I lost all traffic, and not because of Google.","I live in the Netherlands. Working as a FE dev, and when I have time, I work on different websites and try to rank them in Google.

Five years ago, I started a simple blog and redesigned it multiple times until it got some traffic. Reading Brian Dean's work and coping his strategies helped me to rank several pages for competitive Dutch keywords. It was a blast and felt great.

Then I decided to take it to the next level with a new domain name and of course another design. I was sure I would crush it for even the most competitive keywords.

The new domain was live, the content was ready, and I just needed to switch the DNS and everything would be good to go. But things didn't go as planned.

There were several mistakes. Yes, I forgot to update the robots.txt, but that was fixed quickly and without errors. And yes, I had to switch domains only and keep the design as it was... all true.

The biggest mistake, though. I forgot to redirect the existing redirects on the old site..

My old site had some strong backlinks pointing to non-existent pages. But I handled those correctly. They all were 301 redirected to decent pages.

The real problem caused the most damage. When adding redirects to the **new** domain, I only redirected existing pages that had 200 status codes. This meant I lost a lot of backlink value from previous correctly handled 404 pages.

Still with me?

Basically, traffic surged, and I went from 3000 to 150 visitors per month.

I had been patient, but after a month or two, I realized I had messed up. I saw the broken backlinks and understood that I had lost a lot of value.

After months of trying to bounce back, hope returned in April. I saw a huge increase in impressions and clicks. Until the spam update. It all went down again. And I haven't found the drive to try it all over again.

Nytro SEO is a Spam Tool and a Scam Company - Detailed Review,"**SCAM ALERT**  
I have personally used the tool on a website that I cannot name here but this tool only spams keywords into the meta tags and calls it AI automation. The keywords are not even right most of the time. That is why I am creating this review so that it can save others. Please note that I haven't seen a higher or lower traffic due to this tool yet because it is early for my website but I am trying to get rid of it and consider it a scam due to the reasons listed below.  
**Update:** We removed this tool after about 2 months and our traffic wasn't affected at all. It's been another 2 months after this tool's removal. This tool does nothing.

**The Good**

1. I have no idea how they got good reviews on [App Sumo](https://appsumo.com/products/nytroseo/). But they have **4.9 stars** with 75 reviews which seems pretty good. This is the only positive that I have found about the tool on the web that I couldn't refute so wanted to mention this first to not make this one-sided.

**Update**: I have seen another review of this tool in which **App Sumo itself removed the negative review** for this tool. You can read the other review at the end. So, that explains the high rating. I have nothing good to say about this tool.

**The Bad**

1. **Nytro SEO Website**: Props to them for using the tool on their own domain( [nytroseo.com](http://nytroseo.com) ). According to Semrush, they get 105 monthly traffic on a sitemap containing about 500 URLs with 192 blog posts. 0.21/page if you do the math. And their website just started getting some traffic in May 2024 after getting wiped out completely in Mid-2022. They have consistently added content(posts) to the website during the 2 years. So, the lack of effort wasn't the issue for those drops. They share no case studies or ""before and after"" results of users on their website and it is only a long list of testimonials that I absolutely do not trust.
2. **Tutorial Website**: Most of their YouTube tutorial videos are about their own website's domain but [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmGhsfjBIYQ) had [slumberrparty.com](http://slumberrparty.com) with the extra ""r"". And its Semrush traffic shows a decline from peak of 3412 in June  2024 to now a declining trend of 1852 in August 2024. I am guessing the Google updates figured out the spam and it's gonna go down even further.
3. **Reddit Reviews**: All the positive reviews of this tool on reddit are through ghost accounts used for faking social proof. I really hate this tool and the team that's using these fake tactics to scam people. You can just view 1 or 2 profiles with positive reviews and you'll get the idea.
4. **Review Websites**: It got awarded the best AI automation tool of the week or month by [Five Taco](https://fivetaco.com/products/nytro-seo-automated-software). Turns out that this company's domain was registered in Jan 2024. It is more like FAKE TACO. **Edit**: Five Taco is part of the sumo company so there's some legitimacy to it.
5. **YouTube Reviews**: You can find its positive reviews on no-name AI voiced affiliate channels like App Zone and Web Whizz and others. Crowded Lab's review was negative but lenient. It's the closest thing to honest review. Some guy **Mark J Draper** with 17k subscribers [pushed this tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZjcCJNzXzk) as great but if you look at his videos you'll see he just became a SaaS Tool expert in the last 6,7 months probably because of the sponsorship and affiliate links he found on app sumo. He has a wide range of past physical tech reviews but the recent ones are definitely cash grabs. His own website's domain [clixoni.com](http://clixoni.com) that he used in the review is getting no traffic on semrush and he has declared the tool great. He's bluffing.
6. **Office Building**: If you go to their [Contact Us](https://nytroseo.com/contact-us/) Page then you'll find that they mention the address: 26 Broadway, Suite 934. New York, NY 10004. But, if you look up this address then you'll find that it is provided by a virtual office service [here](https://www.opusvirtualoffices.com/virtual-office/new-york/new-york/location-1450/). You can also buy yourself an address in that building for just $99/month. This company is an absolute scam with no physical offices and no credibility.

**Summary**: They are **faking everything**. From reddit reviews to YouTube reviews to website reviews. They are even faking their office address. Maybe not the App Sumo reviews.

Sorry, if the title is too SEOy but I want this review to show up in the search to save others. I do not have any personal vendetta against them but this company really frustrates me with the low-quality and potentially harmful service and tries to cover it up with this FAKE PR.

Let me know if you guys have any questions. And please moderators approve this.

Theory: Google Search Leak as a PR Stunt,"It is quite conceivable that the alleged ""leak"" of Google Search data was in fact just an elaborate PR stunt by Google itself. 

Here are my reasons that could support this theory:

1. No really sensitive data was leaked: The leaked information contained internal documents, but nothing truly compromising or shocking for Google. The data could have been carefully selected.
2. Support for existing Best Practices: The leak basically said, create great content. There were even vage mentions of a  ""gold standard"" that can differentiate between human content and AI content.
3. Mysterious Circumstances: The circumstances of the leak seem very dubious and staged: A huge amount of data on a randomly found, unsecured server hard drive? That sounds almost too adventurous.

Insane to start a news website in 2024?,"For some time I have been considering starting a news website. After buying a domain last year I slammed on the brakes amid all the upheaval caused by the HCU. I've been dithering ever since about whether it's worth at least giving it a shot.  
The concept:

* English-language news articles based on a selection of sources from online newspaper articles to YouTube videos, etc. The source content is non-English (I am bilingual)
* The articles would be well-written and rather than just translating in full (which would ofc be a copyright violation) would derive from more than one source, which would be linked. The content would be transformative—would add analysis/commentary/humor
* Mostly focusing on stories with viral potential

Feel free to pile on and tell me how clueless I am and how this is a terrible idea. I am well aware I'd be swimming against the tide. The only reason I can't quite let go of it is that I see some websites based on a similar concept that have terrible UI, that don't have great content (including one that hasn't had a new article published since late last year), and yet that still seem to rank high-ish in the search results for my target key words.",0.85,12,44,r/SEO,2024-06-04T11:16:27.000Z,post,,t3_1d7ulwn,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1d7ulwn/insane_to_start_a_news_website_in_2024/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1d7ulwn/insane_to_start_a_news_website_in_2024/,t2_anar96xi8,SeymourKleevij,"The Reddit post questions the viability of starting a news website in 2024.

Making SEO Data Resonate: Effective Data Storytelling for Clients and Stakeholders,"In our latest blog post, Lazarina Stoy split apart the data storytelling process into simple steps. She shared real-world examples and practical tips for avoiding common pitfalls and creating stories that resonate with your audience. We brought you key takeaways from the article, but don't hesitate to read the entire thing.

**Key components of a data story include the setup, conflict, and resolution** 

The Setup paints a picture of the current situation. The Conflict comprises any event that changes this reality and disrupts the status quo. The Resolution is the new reality emerging from the conflict that you can derive actionable insights from. 

**Data storytelling is a technique that combines various skills**

It includes data science, data visualization, relationship management, and narrative skills to communicate data insights and drive action.

**Identify the perfect story by monitoring meaningful events**

There is almost always a story to tell around the SEO data you work with. Major updates, Google’s new features, and other changes can all largely impact your website’s performance, providing interesting stories to discuss about your SEO data.

**Know your audience and focus on the metrics they care about most**

Different audiences require different reporting styles. Know who your audience is and tell stories with the metrics that matter most to them. For instance, team members or project managers generally need reports that are more detailed and packed with tactical insights. For C-level individuals, you should emphasize higher-level strategies, KPIs, and business impact.

**Create an unbiased data story**

Creating fact-based SEO reports is essential for gaining and retaining client trust. One common mistake is to craft narratives that are more appealing than factual. For instance, some companies have been too quick to integrate generative AI and ChatGPT into their SEO strategies. Some even made the mistake of replacing their content teams with AI without solid evidence of its effectiveness. Exaggerated assertions about the capabilities of generative AI led to subpar content quality.

**Build a story around one central insight or “protagonist” metric**

Focus on one key insight or ""protagonist"" metric that resonates with your client's emotions and goals to craft a story that captivates and motivates them to take action.

**Deliver SEO data story effectively by providing context and benchmarks**

SEO doesn't happen in a bubble. Context matters. Provide this context during one-on-one coaching sessions, in report documentation, and even in emails prior to your presentations.

**Use clear language, choose the right visualizations and colors, suggest next steps, and encourage discussion through live story broadcasting**

Simplify the data to make it easy for your audience to spot patterns and insights. Clarify, don’t confuse (or even worse – offend) your audience. Make your data actionable by assisting your audience in understanding how to use this information to achieve their goals.

**Practice data storytelling skills with diverse resources**

Becoming a data storytelling pro takes time and effort. That’s why we created this list full of helpful points.",0.99,12,1,r/SEO,2024-05-21T17:42:09.000Z,post,,t3_1cxdti0,,,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cxdti0/making_seo_data_resonate_effective_data/,False,SEO,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1cxdti0/making_seo_data_resonate_effective_data/,t2_uhf0wrxd,SE_Ranking,"The Reddit post discusses the importance of data storytelling in the realm of SEO, emphasizing how effectively communicating data can enhance understanding and engagement among clients and stakeholders.

Do People Read Long (1000+ words) Articles? ,"The most common approach in SEO is to write long articles, optimized with keywords and covering the topic end-to-end.

AI detectors are a scram,"Someone needs to say this: there's no reliable way to detect if a piece of content was written by AI or a human. The modern LLMs generate text at a quality level comparable to humans. AI can adapt formatting, tone, and mimic specific voices or accents if prompted. It can even replicate a Ukrainian or Indian accent if asked, and vice versa. An intelligent human being can impersonate others or even simulate early days LLMs.

As I conduct demos of my SEO tool, hipa.ai, I frequently encounter seasoned SEO specialists talking about ""AI detectors."" Let’s be clear: these so-called detectors are ineffective. Many in SEO claim Google can detect AI-generated content, but Google doesn’t do this by ""reading"" the content itself. Instead, Google monitors for patterns. For instance, if a website hasn’t published anything for a year and suddenly releases 400 articles in a week, it’s likely AI-generated. Similarly, Google tracks author activity. If an author who previously didn’t publish often suddenly begins releasing content in bulk, or if a recipe writer abruptly switches to covering crypto and a dozen other unrelated topics, that inconsistency raises red flags and suggests artificial content.

Additionally, Google tends to favor standard CMS platforms or frameworks, like Docusaurus. Custom-built publishing engines can facilitate automated, high-volume content generation, which Google may scrutinize more closely. Standard platforms (like [Medium](http://medium.com)) lack APIs for automating publication, adding a level of manual oversight.

My company was the largest publisher of ChatGPT plugins back in 2023 developing more than 25 plugins, and we considered creating an AI detector plugin ourselves. Although we suspected it wouldn’t be feasible, we investigated anyway. Ultimately, we confirmed that there's no reliable way to determine if content was AI-generated.

What would you do in this situation? Ecommerce site and I have to abandon domain.,"My girlfriend has been running an e-commerce store for about two years, and three months ago, someone trademarked the brand name we were using. They reached out and gave us a deadline of two months to change our domain. We’ve already built up a good number of backlinks and are getting solid daily traffic.

They don’t want us using the name anymore, but they didn’t ask us to hand over the domain and they agreed to take it over later this year.
