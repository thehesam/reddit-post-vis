"In this analysis, I will present some hard, cold data and stats that clearly show what many have suspected all along but didn't have the voice/analytical chops/platform to demonstrate -- that sophisticated Negative SEO attacks are very real and pervasive.

More importantly, I will demonstrate through stats, facts, data that sophisticated and persistent negative SEO attacks do the real damage to the effected websites, putting companies and publishers out of business, while rewarding the attacker -- all thanks to the gaping holes in Google's search algo that attackers are exploiting to the detriment of unsuspecting website owners.

In this case study, we will focus on 7 to 10 unrelated (independent, separately owned) websites in the Home Remodeling and remodeling project pricing space. All the websites presented in the table below have been established authorities in their respective domains/niches.

**Note:** All the websites analyzed below are independently owned and achieved growth leveraging their own talents/strategies/tactics. These websites were doing well in Google search until they were attacked by a massive, sophisticated, and persistent, negative SEO campaigns, which were **identified** and **confirmed** through the analysis of GSC and SEMRush data in **early 2021** and beyond. The **attacks are still ongoing** even though these **websites have already lost between 90% to 99.9%** of their organic search traffic from Google.

Here is the **table** showing the list of the effected websites targeted with **persistent** (and ongoing) **Neg SEO** that were a part of this analysis.

# The anatomy of negative SEO:

The types of harmful backlinks and other ""goodies"" that were identified as part of the pattern of this negative SEO attack against [RoofingCalc.com](http://RoofingCalc.com), [PickHvac.com](http://PickHvac.com), [RemodelingCalculator.org](http://RemodelingCalculator.org), and others:

·      **Tens of thousands** of unnatural external links built on a vast network of hacked websites with cloaked pages that show one version of the page to the Google bot, and an entirely different experience to the user. Comprising the following websites/domains:

o   Cloaked domains/URLs (with copy-pasted content from a target website)

[These types of harmful backlinks mostly cannot be seen in SEMRush due to a cloaking mechanism and redirect](https://preview.redd.it/02qxe77skn3d1.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00060f44ff4e66dde59893530f008bec4a6eaba2)

[Cloaked websites\/URLs on non-sensical domains for the topic \(often showing copy-pasted content from the victim's sit to Google\)](https://preview.redd.it/hkvujcp6jn3d1.png?width=2407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e3abc522e7fc390ea0844522e3fd466a587a475)

o   Nonsensical domains

o   Subdomains

o   Russian domains

o   Chinese domains

o   Low-quality wiki websites

o   Adult-themed domains

o   Gambling-themed domains

Notably, the cloaked pages would often contain a copy-and-paste of the target website content/html code (but you cannot see it directly unless you access it as a google bot due to a cloaking mechanism). The cloaked pages would often be infested with Malware and redirect the user to a casino or gambling website of some sort. The SEMRush was mostly not able to pick up these garbage links due to a cloaking action – the only way these backlinks were discovered was through GSC.

·       Hacked WordPress websites with backlinks having the following patterns:

o   http://HackedWordPressWebsite.com/blog**/g83vgfregbd/**gibberish-article-with-a-link-to-your-site

[Harmful backlinks on hacked sites pointing to RoofingCalc.com - SEMRush Nov 25 2022](https://preview.redd.it/jjddzs0xhn3d1.png?width=2052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad5ee4c77b262e737b6db2aa5a9406e4651a9698)

o   Blogspot and Web 2.0 sites with tens of thousands of outgoing links and gibberish content – Is blogspot still a Google-owned property? It appears the attackers leverage Googles-owned assets to carry out their attacks.

o   Invisible/cloaked backlinks form strange pages with a “-k.html” pattern. While we see these links on normal “non-attacked” sites, the sheer quantity and volume of these as seen in SEMRush can be a red flag to alert of a potential negative SEO attack.

# What if any disavow action has been taken?

A limited disavow links action has been done at different time intervals in GSC, with a meticulous approach – only truly toxic domains with obvious malicious intent and unrelated content were disavowed – no machines – all backlinks were examined manually by humans. But, because many hundreds and thousands of new attacking domains would appear in GSC every week – it became too overwhelming trying to keep for the business owners. The sheer volume of these harmful domains pointing backlinks to the websites were mind-bugling.

Notably, we have observed a consistent \~50% overlap in toxic (cloaked and hacked) domains pointing links to the effected websites in the Google Search Console, suggesting that GSC was either grossly underreporting the true numbers of toxic backlinks they (Google) are seeing, or reflecting the vastness of the hacked websites (and negative PBN networks created for negative SEO) such that the attackers could use similar but not identical websites to carry out the attacks against these websites.

It was clear that the attacks were largely automated, leveraging thousands of hacked websites, as well as websites owned by networks of negative SEO firms (negative SEO PBNs) designed to do harm.

Even with the Google Search Console underreporting the true numbers of cloaked/hacked websites pointing backlinks to these websites, we are estimating hundreds of thousands of domains that have been used, thus far, to carry out these attacks.

Next week (or more likely in two weeks), I am planning to share an analysis for a different vertical (how about home solar space? Any interest) to show that this is pervasive and goes beyond a specific vertical.

But the bottom line is that negative SEO is very real, and my goal with this post was to help spread awarenss of this gaping hole that is being exploited by sociopaths to harm innocent website publishers/businesses.

Google if you are reading this, maybe it's high time to confront the issue and do something about it?

The best thing you can do is help spread the awareness, so Google might actually do something to address the gaping hole they created in the ecosystem of the web by enabling the negative SEO, and rewarding the attacker.

Comprising the following websites/domains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Cloaked domains/URLs (with copy-pasted content from a target website)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/02qxe77skn3d1.png?width=1492&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=00060f44ff4e66dde59893530f008bec4a6eaba2""&gt;These types of harmful backlinks mostly cannot be seen in SEMRush due to a cloaking mechanism and redirect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/hkvujcp6jn3d1.png?width=2407&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e3abc522e7fc390ea0844522e3fd466a587a475""&gt;Cloaked websites/URLs on non-sensical domains for the topic (often showing copy-pasted content from the victim&amp;#39;s sit to Google)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Nonsensical domains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Subdomains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Russian domains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Chinese domains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Low-quality wiki websites&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Adult-themed domains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Gambling-themed domains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the cloaked pages would often contain a copy-and-paste of the target website content/html code (but you cannot see it directly unless you access it as a google bot due to a cloaking mechanism). The cloaked pages would often be infested with Malware and redirect the user to a casino or gambling website of some sort. The SEMRush was mostly not able to pick up these garbage links due to a cloaking action – the only way these backlinks were discovered was through GSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·       Hacked WordPress websites with backlinks having the following patterns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   &lt;a href=""http://HackedWordPressWebsite.com/blog**/g83vgfregbd/**gibberish-article-with-a-link-to-your-site""&gt;http://HackedWordPressWebsite.com/blog**/g83vgfregbd/**gibberish-article-with-a-link-to-your-site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/jjddzs0xhn3d1.png?width=2052&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ad5ee4c77b262e737b6db2aa5a9406e4651a9698""&gt;Harmful backlinks on hacked sites pointing to RoofingCalc.com - SEMRush Nov 25 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Blogspot and Web 2.0 sites with tens of thousands of outgoing links and gibberish content – Is blogspot still a Google-owned property? It appears the attackers leverage Googles-owned assets to carry out their attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o   Invisible/cloaked backlinks form strange pages with a “-k.html” pattern. While we see these links on normal “non-attacked” sites, the sheer quantity and volume of these as seen in SEMRush can be a red flag to alert of a potential negative SEO attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What if any disavow action has been taken?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limited disavow links action has been done at different time intervals in GSC, with a meticulous approach – only truly toxic domains with obvious malicious intent and unrelated content were disavowed – no machines – all backlinks were examined manually by humans. But, because many hundreds and thousands of new attacking domains would appear in GSC every week – it became too overwhelming trying to keep for the business owners. The sheer volume of these harmful domains pointing backlinks to the websites were mind-bugling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, we have observed a consistent ~50% overlap in toxic (cloaked and hacked) domains pointing links to the effected websites in the Google Search Console, suggesting that GSC was either grossly underreporting the true numbers of toxic backlinks they (Google) are seeing, or reflecting the vastness of the hacked websites (and negative PBN networks created for negative SEO) such that the attackers could use similar but not identical websites to carry out the attacks against these websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear that the attacks were largely automated, leveraging thousands of hacked websites, as well as websites owned by networks of negative SEO firms (negative SEO PBNs) designed to do harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the Google Search Console underreporting the true numbers of cloaked/hacked websites pointing backlinks to these websites, we are estimating hundreds of thousands of domains that have been used, thus far, to carry out these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week (or more likely in two weeks), I am planning to share an analysis for a different vertical (how about home solar space? Any interest) to show that this is pervasive and goes beyond a specific vertical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the bottom line is that negative SEO is very real, and my goal with this post was to help spread awarenss of this gaping hole that is being exploited by sociopaths to harm innocent website publishers/businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google if you are reading this, maybe it&amp;#39;s high time to confront the issue and do something about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do is help spread the awareness, so Google might actually do something to address the gaping hole they created in the ecosystem of the web by enabling the negative SEO, and rewarding the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

"Hi everyone,

I'm a developer and, talking with other developers, I realized their knowledge on technical SEO (and SEO in general) is practically non existent.

"Google’s official position as expressed by John M. and repeated (parroted?) by the many “SEO influencers” on LinkedIn/Twitter-X/Reddit is that harmful backlinks cannot hurt your website because Google will simply ignore any backlinks it deems unnatural.

Let’s examine this logic a bit, shall we?

If that’s indeed the case - that unnatural/harmful/toxic backlinks cannot hurt your website and should be simply ignored, then what’s the point of having the disavow tool at all? Seriously, why not just nuke it, Google? 

- Someone built a ton of PBN links to your site from a penalized PBN network - no problem, Google will simply ignore it.

- Someone is building countless links and copy pasting your content on hacked websites with cloaked pages? No problem, Google will simply ignore everything even if that practice violates their quality guidelines.

- Someone is buying backlinks to your site to implicate you/your website - no problem, Google has got your back!

So, if no amount and duration of unnatural backlinks can hurt you, then what’s the point of having the disavow tool?

Does the disavow tool even do anything? Why is it not a deprecated tool like the others?

Google needs plausible deniability and wants webmasters/website owners to be confused and think that they may have the option to address harmful backlinks attacks against their websites (Google thinks it’s probably you who built those links in the first place in an attempt to game their search engine and they want you to think you might have an option to disavow them if you so choose). No, disavowing backlinks probably won’t help you.

The reality is that Google very much penalizes websites algorithmically for manipulating its search algo through unnatural backlinks, but does not want this advertised (keep it under the wraps) to avoid lawsuits and bad PR.

Countless websites get demoted and relegated to obscurity for unnatural linking patters, PBN networks, hacked websites linking to you and using your content - the longer it goes on the greater the penalty effects over time. 

No, unfortunately it’s not just pure speculation, there is plenty of hard data to unequivocally prove negative SEO is real and does real damage thanks to Google penalizing it algorithmically. I can share a detailed independent analysis and case studies spanning multiple cases over the last few years to prove this.

2. **Linking to Category Pages:** Should a specific movie review page for an 'action movie' contextually link to the 'action movie' category page? Users can already navigate there via breadcrumb navigation. Does adding more links provide any SEO benefit?

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I programmatically check if Google suggests alternative queries and identifies similar brand domains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

"Hi all,

I'm wondering what kind of work do tech seo freelancers perform monthly for a long-herm client, so not one-off projects (migrations, audits...) and where you exclusively do tech SEO - meaning you're not a regular SEO manager that also builds backlinks, does content writing/planning/briefs etc.

With my clients, I'm a ""fractional technical SEO"", meaning I help in-house teams that don't need full-time tech SEO or the client's SEO team doesn't have the time to work on it.

As a part of their team, i have access like an employee (jira, slack, github, AWS, guest on Teams etc.) where I, amongst other tasks:

* monitor GSC (and server logs)
* write and QA dev tickets
* communicate with devs/marketing/content teams etc., &amp; have weekly/monthly meetings with them
* get on calls with stakeholders to help with buy-in :)
* collaborate with possible external SEO agencies
* audit/crawl the site each sprint (staging vs live)
* \+  there's always ""scope creep""- I start with tech SEO, then jump in to help in other places - merchant center (feeds), recommend new category pages (for eComm clients), advise with CRO and UX, internal linking, content audits, make mockups of new PLPs and PDPs, suggest product bundles, upsells etc.

I'm also interested about the pricing - do you get paid by hour or work on a retainer?

"Hi everyone

Recently I was able to reduce my INP from 300ms to 160ms after struggling to fix it for 3 months! Here's a summary of how I did it in case it's helpful for any of you (I also wrote a [post](https://www.remoterocketship.com/advice/how-i-debugged-and-fixed-inp) with the fulls details):  
  
Firstly, my web site is built with Nextjs / React

* [Jacob Groß](https://x.com/kurtextrem), a senior performance engineer at Framer, has a great [post](https://kurtextrem.de/INP.pdf) on how to improve INP in React. My two biggest takeaways:
   * Use concurrent mode features like [startTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) and [useDeferedvalue](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue) to schedule changes as non-urgent and non-blocking
   * Mark components as non-urgent by using ""selective hydration"" i.e. [suspense boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) (or [dynamic imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) if you're using Next.js)
* I implemented his recommdations but still my INP was 260ms
* Then I tried 3 different tools to monitor INP:
   * DebugBear: It's great but way too expensive
   * Vercel Speed Insights: A nice UI but doesn't give enough information
   * Eventually I just implemented [Google's web-vitals library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) and logged metrics myself. I combined this with session replays so I could actually see what people were doing when the bad INP was logged 🤯
* I found the problematic component (a menu dropdown). Two issues I noticed:
   * 1. After using the React Profiler and enabling ""**highlight updates when components render**"", I saw the menu items were constantly re-rendering when scrolling. To fix this I memoize the menu items
   * 2. Opening the menu was causing a spike on mobile devices. To fix this I used a combination of state to open the menu and \`startTransition()\` so that the keyboard has a chance to open first before the menu

That's it!

"Hi all,

Used this checklist for a couple of our smaller websites, moving from magento 1 to 2.

Will be doing out big 6 websites soon.

Is there anything I should add?  

I'm a 1-man SEO team, but it sometimes helps, if I can highlight security risks and other stuff to the devs...

"Hi Community,

I'd like some expert opinions to understand why my SEO isn't working.

I created a website a year ago, and have slowly been adding to it since. But get basically zero traffic.

I've done all the technical seo stuff (went through several checklists, and got a high lighthouse score).

I've tried a few off page things (admitedly nothing came of these yet) eg build back links, but didn't get anywhere.

Google search console for the last 28 days shows 59 impressions, 2 clicks, and an average position of 57.8.

My site is kind of niche (finding guides for mountaineering), but also broad - because there are loads of possible mountains. Maybe that's a problem?

I want to rank for each mountain, eg 'climb aconcagua' 'climb kilimanjaro' 'climb lobuche east'.

Some of those searches are competitive, but not particularly. And most have little competition.

Sometimes I post in various related reddits and get some inbounch traffic, but it doesn't last.

My goal is to rank on google/etc.

How can I improve things?

"OK, here's the deal: my clients' website is indexed for literally hundreds (nearly 1,000) keywords that are incredibly bad - think of the worst adult-themed keyword that involves minors. I was really surprised b/c I took these indexed keywords from Ahrefs and double-checked and yes, they are indexed with the homepage.

Here are the steps I took and my suspicion at the bottom of this post...

1. Check if the site has been hacked and the keywords are there. Nothing.

2. Check if the site has tiny font or white-text. Nothing

3. Check for ultra-spammy links. Seems to be nothing in the SEMRush toxic report.

So...here's my hunch and fix....

I believe that we might be the victim of Google Cloaking.

To validate this, my process would be to request access to their GSC (I didn't have it before but since I brought this to light I am getting all access) and ""Fetch As Google"" which I believe checks the rendering of a page using a Google IP Address. So, if I am correct then the dodgy keywords will be visible?

Can anyone chime in with my thought-process and/or ideas of how these keywords have been indexed for the domain?

My guide is a collection of measures that can be carried out in a structured manner and is aimed at SEOs who work with websites that can benefit from structural optimizations. He first briefly introduces the topic of structural optimization and then first deals with fixing obvious errors that can cause an infinite number of URLs. Phase 2 then deals with collecting data for structural analysis, phase 3 with the structural optimization of page types and page areas, phase 4 with strengthening individual pages and phase 5 concludes the topic with ways to improve discoverability and crawl efficiency.

We’re building a marketplace platform on Bubble.io, but since Bubble is known to be slow and negatively affects Core Web Vitals (like LCP, FID, and CLS), it’s impacting our SEO performance.

"Hey everyone!

I’m looking for some advice from those of you who manage big e-commerce projects. I’ve been offered a chance to join a marketplace development team, and I’m trying to wrap my head around handling large amounts of data.

One of the main challenges right now is auditing a website during the early (restructure) development stages and collecting up-to-date info on page statuses and redirect structures. The thing is, we’re dealing with hundreds of thousands of pages per day.

Here’s the problem: How relevant is the audit data by the time we actually get it? For example, auditing 300,000 (X3 in the future iterations) pages can take several hours, maybe even a whole day. But by the time it’s done, things might’ve already changed on the site.

So I’m curious is it better to go for a faster audit with a little loss in accuracy? Or stick with a full, detailed audit that could take all day but gives a complete picture?

What do you think, based on your experience with big projects?

"Hey everyone. I've recently migrated my 11-year-old domain to a new domain name. Here's a summary of what I've done so far before you ask:

1. 301 Redirects: All URLs were properly redirected via 301 to the corresponding pages on the new domain.
2. Google Search Console Updates: The domain change was registered, and all necessary migration actions were completed.
3. Sitemaps Submitted: New sitemaps for the updated domain structure were submitted to Google.
4. Backlink Profile: I started updating my backlinks to reflect the new domain.

It's been 42 days since the migration, but I've encountered significant issues with my traffic and indexing. Here is the issue:

In the last 7 days, my old domain (which was fully redirected) has started receiving 546K clicks, while the new domain has only received 31K clicks. Initially, the old domain showed zero traffic (as expected after the migration). Still, it has suddenly become visible again in Google search and outperforms the new domain by over 500K clicks.

This unexpected behavior has me very concerned and confused about what might be causing it.

So here are the things that I'm wondering. If you can help me, that'd be very nice!

1. Why is the old domain receiving so much traffic despite the 301 redirects? Is this normal?
2. Could this be due to an issue with how Google processes the migration?
3. How can I fix this and ensure traffic is correctly transferred to the new domain?

* “Google’s search volume numbers? Always rounded—so not super precise.”
* “Everything in the API is based on AdWords data, which groups keywords together even if the intent is totally different.”
* “You can’t break down search volume by device type (unless something has changed recently).”
* “And let’s not even get started on pricing or how complicated Google’s API can be. I’ve tried it for other projects, and wow, what a nightmare.”

&lt;li&gt;“If a keyword is restricted in Google Ads, their API won’t give you any data.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Google’s search volume numbers? Always rounded—so not super precise.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Everything in the API is based on AdWords data, which groups keywords together even if the intent is totally different.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You can’t break down search volume by device type (unless something has changed recently).”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“And let’s not even get started on pricing or how complicated Google’s API can be. I’ve tried it for other projects, and wow, what a nightmare.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Oh, and third-party APIs? Way cheaper.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m sitting here wondering are these issues really that common, or is this just the internet being dramatic?&lt;/p&gt;

"Hello all,

I am reaching out to you for help and sanity check. Thank you all in advance! 

I am working on a website of about ~5K URLs that has the languages of EN and ES under the same EN url. The language changes on the page via an api call but the url remains the same and language is handled based on the language cookie thereafter. I submitted a request to their dev team to have Spanish urls that host the Spanish content so that search engines crawl and index the pages to rank for Spanish queries. 

Their dev team created a solution that will automatically populate all 5K Spanish pages for all the URLs in Spanish but can't change the in-page outlines on each page. So it means, for sometime English inlinks will exist on Spanish content pages. 

The solution takes in consideration the user and provides a good user experience by making sure the user will be able to see the preferred language throughout their journey. For example if they landed on a Spanish page (.com/es/spanish-language) and an outlink on that page is still the English (.com/en/english-language) then based on the below, the user will continue to see the ES content and the URL will change to the ES vesion on their browser with the use of the replacestate() in the browser history api.

1. The cookie
2. If the user requested a URL with a parameter of .com/en/english-language?setLanguage=es
3. If the page, they currently on, has a /es/ prefix

My question is would google see the replacstate() and consider a redirect from the EN URL to the ES URL?

I have been working on improving the speed of this site for some time, but of course the day-to-day grind can get in the way. I was finally able to dedicate some time to it this past week and here's the updated score. Mobile is @ on 83 so still have some work to do there.

# Overview of the site

**CMS:** WordPress, version 6.6.1

**PHP:** 7.4 (a bit behind, but the most recent version breaks the site so fixing that next)

**Hosting:** WPEngine

# What I did to improve things (yes, no broken functionality and tracking all still works):

* Plugin cleanup
   * I reviewed the site and removed plugins we were no longer actively using (not just deactivated, also deleted completely) + updated to newest version on others we were using.
* Installed NitroPack (not a plug, it's just one I heard great things about so I gave it a shot).

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on improving the speed of this site for some time, but of course the day-to-day grind can get in the way. I was finally able to dedicate some time to it this past week and here&amp;#39;s the updated score. Mobile is @ on 83 so still have some work to do there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Overview of the site&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CMS:&lt;/strong&gt; WordPress, version 6.6.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHP:&lt;/strong&gt; 7.4 (a bit behind, but the most recent version breaks the site so fixing that next)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosting:&lt;/strong&gt; WPEngine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What I did to improve things (yes, no broken functionality and tracking all still works):&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin cleanup

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reviewed the site and removed plugins we were no longer actively using (not just deactivated, also deleted completely) + updated to newest version on others we were using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installed NitroPack (not a plug, it&amp;#39;s just one I heard great things about so I gave it a shot).

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used the pagespeed boost option with WPEngine so you can&amp;#39;t customize, but I said screw it, let&amp;#39;s do the most aggressive option, which was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ludicrous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

"Hey everyone,

I've access to a GSC of a very recently launched website (04/10). Gbot found URLs with uppercase characters (eg. example.com/Page1.html) but I only have lowercase URLs. The wrong URLs are all responding 200 OK.

If I inspect the URL, it correctly finds the canonical pointed to the lowercase version and, in fact, G marks them as ""Alternate page with proper canonical tag"". The referring page marked by GSC is the lowercase one.

Even after a crawl with the frog I wasn't able to find the uppercase URLs gbot is spotting. Since this very specific section (it's a subdomain but I don't really think it's making any difference) is brand new, I don't think some URLs may already be around, but I'm checking.

Last but not least, even after a check with Ahrefs I wasn't able to spot backlinks (not that I really expected to find something in the first place...)

"I think we're on the way to resolving this one but thought it was worth posting for others to be aware and share in my disbelief this could happen.

I'm working with a client who's on Magento so we've got a fairly robust robots.txt in place to control the flood of pages automatically created. One such rule is:

    Disallow: *?*=

From what I can tell this is fairly standard for Magento (although i'd be happy to be corrected if people have a better perspective).

About a month ago the visibility in AHREFs absolutely plummeted, seeming coinciding with the recent spam update so all attention has been there (looking at backlinks, updating content, page titles etc.)

Until we discovered something in Search Console. All of the category pages have a 'Google Selected Canonical' which includes '?product\_list\_limit=all'. 

So '/category-url' is being ignored and Google has selected '/category-url?product\_list\_limit=all' as it's selected canonical, and because of the above rule that page is blocked to robots.

This isn't a new rule, so it leaves me wondering how Google suddenly started favouring these pages it can even see over the pages it's indexed for a long time. Canonical tags on the site are how you would expect.

For now i've added this rule and the pages are showing as crawlable again in Search Console, but i'm just waiting for them to be reindexed.

DOJ Google Testimony: [https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101823-USA-v-Google-PM.pdf](https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101823-USA-v-Google-PM.pdf)

**About NavBoost and Those Clicks You Heard About.**  
(two posts I made combined from LinkedIn)

The original NavBoost was created circa 2005. It was not a direct ranking signal but part of the culling process when Google created a Search result. Clicks and user engagement factors like dwell time do NOT directly affect rankings in Google.

If you read the DOJ testimony, you will see that these are used in NavBoost dataset.

NavBoost stores 13 months of data about pages and how well they satisfy user queries. However, NavBoost is NEVER used directly in the final SERP rankings.

NavBoost is part of a culling process. You type in a query there are 10s of 1000s of documents that match that query. NavBoost is then used to create a document set of a few hundred from the 10s of 1000s. Part of what NB uses to cull the documents is the stored information about clicks and user engagement OVER the 13 months (It was originally 18 months). HOWEVER, NB is not the only factor used in the culling process. There are other factors and other data miners or otherwise pages with few to no clicks could NEVER rank because they would not be included in the document cull.

NB Is just part of what culls the many documents into a few hundred documents used to create the final SERP. It also creates ""slices"" or mini-data sets for items such as local search, but it never creates the final sort order or ranks it. That is left for other signals and processes, such as the Core Ranking Signals. So, while it may have an indirect influence on the final SERP, it does not directly affect how it is sorted, nor does it create the entire data set used to create that SERP.

NavBoost was not a uniquely individual ranking signal. It wasn't measuring specific clicks to a page and giving it a high placement. It was just using user engagement to cull documents down to a manageable level.

NavBoot works on the ten blue links, Glue brings in the other items that can go on a page but is also part of NavBoost, and Tanagram brings them together to create the layout.

Note NavBoost did change substantially around 2018.

"We wanted to know more about how Shopify's URL redirect works under the hood, more than they share publicly - so we ran some tests and documented the results. 

 The summary of Shopify's URL redirect functionality includes:  
1. Shopify's URL redirect logic is very robust.   
2. From our test of 100 different URL string formats, Shopify &amp; ShopifyPlus native functionality supported 99 out of 100 of the types.   
3. The native system does not support wildcards for URL redirects.  
4. Updating existing URL redirect paths was easy with the import tool, as long as you follow Shopify's undocumented rules (which we've documented for you)  
5. Limits exist with total number of redirects Shopify &amp; ShopifyPlus stores will manage.  
6. Limits exist with the total number of characters for a URL redirect string.  
7. The interface for URL redirect management is user-friendly, but can benefit from more details to help a website owner manage the information.  
8. This test did not examine redirect options available to store owners using Shopify's headless solutions: Hydrogen and Oxygen.

1. Shopify&amp;#39;s URL redirect logic is very robust.&lt;br/&gt;
2. From our test of 100 different URL string formats, Shopify &amp;amp; ShopifyPlus native functionality supported 99 out of 100 of the types.&lt;br/&gt;
3. The native system does not support wildcards for URL redirects.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Updating existing URL redirect paths was easy with the import tool, as long as you follow Shopify&amp;#39;s undocumented rules (which we&amp;#39;ve documented for you)&lt;br/&gt;
5. Limits exist with total number of redirects Shopify &amp;amp; ShopifyPlus stores will manage.&lt;br/&gt;
6. Limits exist with the total number of characters for a URL redirect string.&lt;br/&gt;
7. The interface for URL redirect management is user-friendly, but can benefit from more details to help a website owner manage the information.&lt;br/&gt;
8. This test did not examine redirect options available to store owners using Shopify&amp;#39;s headless solutions: Hydrogen and Oxygen.  &lt;/p&gt;

"Hi everyone,

I need advice on something. My parents have a website which a developer built for them around 15 years ago. The website hasn't changed even one bit since then and it looks extremely old fashioned. However, their google ranking is amazing when someone types the word fasteners which is what they are selling. Their site is currently just an online catalog and now I have the task to transform it into an online shop which I'm using Prestashop for. Now I really don't want them to lose their google ranking but the website will have to change drastically from a custom written simple catalog site to an e-commerce shop. I just started building the site and I'm hosting the it on IONOS with a temporary domain. I want to transfer the domain to the new site but I'm not sure what the best thing to do is in terms of SEO and ranking. Should I:

1. Point the domain directly to the new site and have a 'Site in progress' banner when someone visits
2. Buy a new domain name with the name of the company and shop at the end and redirect the old domain to the new one
3. Keep the old site, try to make it a bit more beautiful and add a link on the old website to the new website in a banner saying ""Checkout our new online shop"" or something similar.

What do you think would be the best thing to do or does it not matter because SEO will be affected anyway and my parents' website will lose its ranking inevitably.

"We currently have hreflang tags setup for the different languages, but our pages have an english fallback if the page isn't translated but on a different language URL subfolder.

(e.g. [domain].com/es/[page]) if not translated, will have a canonical pointing to the english version - this is our english fallback.

- remove english fallbacks (good SEO, not so good for UX) so that you will only see the language you've selected

- add regional target on top of language subfolder targeting

- what's the best way to enable regional + language targeting? I'm thinking, keep the language code subfolder structure, but add on any regional targeting we want to do.

"I'm facing a peculiar rendering issue with a client's website in the Google Search Console's URL Inspection tool and I'm not sure how important it is.

Here's what's happening:

* When viewing the rendered page via the URL Inspection tool, only the logo and a large green rectangle, which is part of a fullscreen background image, are visible. Text and other content elements do not appear at all.
* To maintain privacy, I've added a black overlay over the logo in the screenshot I’m sharing here.
* Interestingly, when using the PageSpeed Insights tool from Google, the page renders correctly on mobile, displaying all content as expected.

This discrepancy in rendering between the URL Inspection tool and PageSpeed Insights is confusing. Here are some details about the site:

* The site uses a significant amount of inline CSS, primarily from Tailwind, which could be impacting the loading or rendering to some extent, though PageSpeed Insights does not indicate major performance issues.
* The site has been live for over a year, and all pages are indexed, but we're struggling with visibility for key terms.

Has anyone encountered a similar issue? Any insights or suggestions on what could be causing this and how to resolve it would be greatly appreciated!

"Hey, need some SEO opinions on an international set up 

We have an international website, but different content needs to be served to different users depending on what country they’re in - even if it’s the same language. This is due to licensing and strict regulations. 

For our English speakers we have:

- example.com/en-gb/ site to target English speakers in the UK with en-gb hreflang

"Hi SEO folks,

I’m working on a fairly complex Single Page Application (SPA) with vehicle listings, and I’m trying to improve its SEO. The main challenge is that our current architecture, based on React.js, doesn't easily allow for pre-rendering.

If it is, instead of serving the React application, I could serve the same content (text and pictures) but as a bare HTML page with the required meta tags and basic body without any formatting.

Has anyone tried a similar approach or have any insights on whether this would be effective for SEO? Are there better alternatives or additional considerations I should be aware of?

"I have an event business, and I want to promote it in different states. I was thinking of building a site for every state we operate in, and on each site be very specific for that state, keep up with (e.g.) California's events, news relating to my niche, etc.

And then again for other states.

I'll be building these up for a few months.

If in month 2, 3 or whatever, I add all the sites to the footer, say ""Our Other Locations"" with all the *other* sites, from each site, is that a PBN? What if on a page with ""Best restaurants in CA"", I show posts from the NY site, showing ""You may be interested in 'Best Restaurants in NY'"" which will be a dofollow to the partnered state-specific site?

I don't necessarily have a money site, but I'd want the sites to obviously be seen as partnered. I'm not trying to obfuscate my ownership of said sites, nor am I building sites for the purpose of spam, but for the business opportunities that may come with state specific targeting.

**So my question is, will this be a problem in google's eyes, or have I just been reading up on a lot of drivel and now I'm worrying about nothing?**

I know big sites do this ""Our Partners"" aka their subsidiaries, but I'm guessing they have a bigger chance of knowing something I don't, so I'm not trying to risk it.

I also don't want to do nofollow to my other sites, since of course, naturally, I'd love if the visitor followed the link to a perhaps more relevant site!

Anyway, just wondering. I'm learning about PBNs and what *not* to do, and it seems those PBNs are just spam dumps for random blog posts and not proper individual brands.

I'd really appreciate all your help! Thank you, and good luck to everyone in these trying times 🤠

"So I'm interning in a company for a digital marketing position and the boss said that he'll maybe wants to hear my insights on SEO since he wants exposure and since my resume said im into SEO. This is a perfect opportunity for me to have an seo experience. So I did a dig to the company website and I can see why his exposure is lacking. 

1. He made the website from scratch from html,css,javascript without using wordpress at all, there's nothing wrong with it at except for maybe it's not semantic and seo optimized. He's using &lt;table&gt; to position his content and not much of &lt;p&gt; and any jsonld. So my question is, is using &lt;table&gt; ok these days?

2. And he also has a separate web page for mobile. These days we only use &lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale 1.0""&gt; right? And I think there's no need to have a separate page for mobile anymore. I will ask the boss if it's intentional that he have that. I also wants to hear opinions if I got it wrong.

3. When should we crawl website again and do we need to put a new sitemap? Should I crawl after changes have been applied? Do we need to constantly recrawl from gsc or is it automatic?

4. Does a organization website need all that &lt;article&gt;&lt;main&gt;&lt;head&gt; etc or is it only good for blogs?

5. Finally, is there source where I can learn about how to fix duplicate and canonicals?

I recently did a migration to Wordpress. My site was doing really well before.   
However, when we moved to Wordpress, unfortunately, my engineer did not account for the ""/"" at the end of wordpress URLs.   
As in, rather than just go to settings and do a custom URL, they left the ""/"" which comes as a default on wordpress and set up redirects.  
For every single article on the site. All 301s worked fine and all sitemaps were fine.

I did audits upon audits and the only thing I found is that my internal URLs were also redirected. Fixed all of them.   


My question is, will I ever recover from this or that's it? I need to pivot and start a new site? Is there any other technical audit I can perform? Apart from screaming frog, SEMRush etc? Is there a silent killer on my site?  


P.S. I think the reason why we hiked those 8 positions was because of the March core update which is still ongoing.

They rank really well, p1 for a load of head keywords.

  
UK is main market for our umbrella company website (sells all sports equipment, not just soccer equipment) - completely separate domains and brand. 

But for brandgoal websites, the UK and US are about equal in sales revenue.

  
Umbrella site is remaining the same.

"I am working on a site that has two separate versions of their site: UK and Australia.

The content is identical, but obviously just serving two separate communities, and we want the content to rank in each individual locale. **UK is the primary site, so naturally we would have set the canonical to the UK, but then Australia wouldn't rank, right?**   
*(please excuse me while I get it right in my head as I'm typing it out so you can understand my reasoning for what I've done)*

* Canonical tags are exclusive, so you are telling Google that [domain.com/uk](http://domain.com/uk) is the canonical, so INDEX ME and not the other version that is otherwise a duplicate. Fine.
* Then hreflang tags are inclusive, so you are telling Google that both [domain.com/uk](http://domain.com/uk) and [domain.com/aus](http://domain.com/aus) are relevant to their respective locales, so INDEX THEM BOTH. Fine.
* But when we add them together:
   * The canonical cays INDEX ME and **not the others**
   * But then hreflang says INDEX ME **AND the others** 

So to avoid confusion, in my research... I found that to use them together, both UK and AUS need to have a self-referencing canonical tag pointing to itself. *(you can see how we've set it up below)*

**This is my first question:** Is that even correct? 

We included hreflang tags so that Australia had a chance of ranking, otherwise we would have just made UK the canonical and be done with it. But *the AUS site is tanking* and we are still getting duplicate content issues. I can understand that we might be getting duplicate content issues due to the way we've set up the canonical tags, but I would prioritise any performance on the AUS site even if it meant having duplicate content issues.

However, we are getting both raw ends of both deals.

Even though we are using self-referencing canonicals, **Google is still choosing the UK as the canonical on the AUS site**. So none of the Australia content is performing.

I've read that when you use a ""catchall"" that sometimes Google will take the catchall as the determining factor that this should be the canonical. In this case, our catchall is the UK. 

**My second question is:** In light of the above, if we change the catchall on the AUS site to &lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""x-default"" href=""https://domain.com/aus""&gt;, will this change the way that Google views the AUS content and possibly start to index it? I feel like so much of this is hypothesising and there's no real certainty around it.

**This is how we've set everything up:**

**Setup for:** [domain.com/uk](http://domain.com/uk)  
  
&lt;link rel=""canonical"" href=""https://domain.com/uk""&gt;  
&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""en-gb"" href=""https://domain.com/uk""&gt;  
&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""en-au"" href=""https://domain.com/aus""&gt;  
&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""en"" href=""https://domain.com/uk""&gt;  
&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""x-default"" href=""https://domain.com/uk""&gt;

**Setup for:** [domain.com/aus](http://domain.com/aus)

&lt;link rel=""canonical"" href=""https://domain.com/aus""&gt;  
&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""en-gb"" href=""https://domain.com/uk""&gt;  
&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""en-au"" href=""https://domain.com/aus""&gt;  
&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""en"" href=""https://domain.com/uk""&gt;  
&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""x-default"" href=""https://domain.com/uk""&gt;

Then, the dev team who is helping me with this has suggested that we point the canonical tags to the UK on both sites. This makes sense on a simplistic level as it would sort out the duplicate content issues, but then Australia doesn't have any hope of performing. 

**My third question:** Am I correct in saying that? I feel like this is a NO GO if we want Australia to have any hope of performing.

**Finally:** Am I correct in saying all of this or is there a crucial step I have missed? I would appreciate any help from anyone else who has experienced this and has some insight to offer. Truly. I will be so grateful for any guidance as I am going around in loops. Thank you.

"My site has hundreds of categories, some of which have thousands of products each. Our pagination is a a ""Load more"" experience. The load more button is actually a link, like `&lt;a href=""/category/dolls?page=2""&gt;Load more&lt;/a&gt;`, and then we use javascript to intercept the click and load the next page of products without doing a hard refresh.

So customers get a nice client-side, load-more-in-place solution, while google sees a properly formatted link which it can follow. If you hard-load `?page=2` then you only see page 2 of the products (i.e. products 11-20).

In addition, we have rel=next/prev set on each page. And every page canonicalises to itself. So on page 2 the canonical URL is page 2, etc.

This all seems to work pretty well, except for two things:

1. Google sometimes picks a page &gt; 1 to show in search results. So if you google ""&lt;company name&gt; dolls"", the top google result could be for `category/dolls?page=3`!
2. Google sometimes puts the ""Load more"" link in the search results as if it's a a sub-category.

[Here's an example screenshot](https://imgur.com/EleXTqv). In this one, google *has* chosen page 1 as the top link (which is good), but it also includes other pages as subcategories. There are other categories where even the main, topmost search result is not page 1.

This seems to be a hard problem to solve. I could canonicalise all the pages back to page 1. Or I could `nofollow` the pages &gt; 1. But that would stop google from crawling those pages altogether, and ultimately hurt search performance on all of the products linked from those categories. For google it would be as if we only sell one page worth of products in each category.

I have checked inside Chrome and website HTML that there in fact is meta tag with description and title I have written inside Yoast SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing I would like to know, right now the website is very badly placed on rankings. How to make the rankings better?&lt;/p&gt;

"I have a website for a therapy practice that ranks for some quality, local-focused keywords around psychedelic-assisted therapy. For a plethora of reasons, we're moving all the psychedelic-assisted therapy posts, information, pages, etc. off of our main therapy website and onto a brand-new psychedelic therapy-focused site (new domain, new everything) but the original website with non-psychedelic topics and the core therapy business will remain intact.

For the pages that have rankings for psychedelic terms, we will be re-creating them on the new website with some slightly different copy, imagery, etc., but they will be *mostly* the same.

For blog posts, I plan to move the exact blog posts from the old site to the new site.

**My question is this:** How should I approach the old pages and posts on the old website that currently have rankings?

1. Should I immediately remove these posts/pages and set up a 301 redirect to the new website's corresponding pages and posts?
2. Or should I leave the old pages and posts with a link at the top (or bottom) pushing traffic to the new website's pages/posts and, in roughly 1-2 months, remove those pages and set up those redirects?
3. Or should I leave those pages indefinitely and use a canonical (not sure where) to help Google understand the switch?
4. Or something completely different than those three options above..?

I expect to see some dip (or complete loss, but hopefully not) in rankings, but I want to mitigate this as much as possible. Thank you in advance!

"I published yesterday an article on Search Engine Journal about a POC that we developed for creating an SEO assistant.

This assistant uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG to provide access to a SEO knowledge base and SaaS tools. More precisely, using external sources (litterature, but also access to SEO tools through APIs), we construct a knowledge graph using langchain, llamaindex and a nebula graph datastorage.

I strongly believe that implementing such systems is game-changer for SEO tasks (more productivity, better strategies). I encourage everyone to replicate our POC, for which I’ve provided the source code in the article.

My concern is about the SEO implications, especially since many of our blog pages currently rank in the top 10 of SERPs. Would setting up redirects be sufficient to maintain our rankings, or are there other strategies I should consider to mitigate potential SEO impacts?

If anyone has faced a similar challenge before, I'd greatly appreciate hearing about your experiences and any advice you have on how to approach this effectively.

"A client's site was hacked via an old Wordpress plugin, and content was mass-injected on the site. I can see from Search Console a few weeks ago there was a huge surge in crawl requests by Googlebot, when the hack took place. 

I don't know why the surge in requests (I can't see a surge in detected backlinks - unless they are blocking SEO bots too) but either way, for a period of time (a week?) the domain started to contain spammy content.

There was no notification or warning from Google - it was just spotted by chance. So, no manual action or security issues are listed in Search Console.

The ""hack"" has been fixed for about 2 weeks now and all spammy URLs have been returning 404 status code, but organic traffic is at about 5% of what it was before the hack.

"Hello,

I am a junior SEO manager working for a Portuguese e-commerce company. I usually resolve my doubts by checking videos on YouTube, blogs, and other resources, but I have a specific issue I can't seem to solve.

Essentially, there's a keyword—I'll refer to it as ""temperos"" (it is a portuguese word) —for the PT/PT URL version, which is meant for the Portuguese store in the Portuguese language. However, when I search for ""temperos"" on Google, the search engine displays the LU/PT version (Luxembourg store, Portuguese language) instead.

Here are the details of my setup:

I have my link rel canonical for [https://www.example.com/pt/pt/menu/temperos](https://www.example.com/pt/pt/menu/temperos) I have the following hreflang code for the PT store:

&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""x-default"" href=""https://www.example.com/pt/en/""&gt;

(this is strategic to avoid discontinued products)

And I have the following hreflang code for that page LU store:

&lt;link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""x-default"" href=""https://www.example.com/lu/en""&gt;


However, both links (for both stores) are competing for the top search results, and in some cases, the LU store ""wins""—even tho I'm in Portugal!

"Hey all,

I’m working on a tool idea aimed at automating a common but time-consuming SEO strategy: using expired domains to build authority and drive link equity. Would love to get some feedback from the pros here to see if this is something you'd find useful or would consider using.

Here's the concept:

The tool would streamline the whole process of taking over an expired domain, building it into an SEO asset, and linking naturally to a target site over time. It would handle everything, from **content creation** to **link placement** and **ongoing updates**, so the site maintains authority without the usual maintenance. The idea is to save **hours of work and budget** while delivering the same link-building benefits.

I’m curious:

* Is this an approach you're using or interested in exploring?
* Would a tool that automates this entire process be valuable to your workflow?
* What are some pain points or challenges you've experienced with expired domain strategies?

Any feedback—whether on the concept, potential use cases, or general challenges you’ve faced with expired domains—would be super helpful. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts!

"Hi there! I am the owner of a reviews &amp; commenting system app for Webflow. A customer of mine is currently using our app on a CMS directory site for crypto projects where visitors can add ratings and text reviews.

One of the features of our app is to sync the average rating and total reviews data into the Webflow CMS, whenever a review gets added, so our users can build custom schemas with aggregateRating data. However, his **rich results are not appearing with star ratings**. I checked Google's rich results tester and it looks like Google is crawling the aggregateRating part of my customer's schema correctly. A few details worth noting:

* His schema type is set to 'Organization'
* Our app currently renders reviews client-side. So Google doesn't always crawl reviews on pages. Rendering server side or prerendering is on our roadmap.
* Most other customers that are creating schemas aren't encountering this issue. But these are recipe blogs and ecommerce sites.

Any idea how we can fix this? Is there another schema type our customer should be using? Or is this never going to be 100% if we are rendering client-side?

&lt;li&gt;Gets impressions and little bit of traffic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few days later it&amp;#39;s de-indexed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are indexing the page again&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[LOOP]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I already checked:&lt;br/&gt;
- Basically the pages are well linked internally&lt;br/&gt;
- There are no technical issues I can see (checked with Google Search Console, ahrefs and also manually by myself and with the developers)&lt;br/&gt;
- The content is really good in my (neutral as possible) opinion&lt;/p&gt;

"So I’m trying to crawl a site that uses infinite scroll on their PLPs. 

The way I’ve approached it is to use the custom JS template from the newer version of SF, however, I’m still only getting 10 products retrieved. I’ve troubleshooted this quite a bit and have rewritten the templated JS scroll script as it wasn’t reaching the true bottom of the page (I tested my script and it works).

Anyone have any ideas why this still isn’t working?

For visibility, 
- JS rendering is on (of course)
- I increased the timeout on the custom JS to 30 secs from 6.
- crawl depth is limited to 1 for testing so I don’t collect products from other PLPs.


Maybe there’s another way to do this with the custom JS script… but idk how and tbh I don’t want to have to write my own custom crawler for this project… that would be a drag. 

Here’s the custom JS script:

const scrollWaitMillis = 3000; // Adjust wait time to allow content to load

function scrollToBottomAndWait(delay) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
        let lastHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;

"Fun Fact: A lot of devs and SEOs are trying to solve the 304 ""error."" If you don't believe me, search this sub. 🤐 

That fact made me put a few words here.

Imagine a website with thousands of pages. Each time a bot crawls your site, serving a 200 status code for unchanged pages means re-downloading each one, consuming bandwidth and crawl budget. 

Instead, serving a 304 status code allows the bot to recognize unchanged content and move on to more important updates, thus making your site's crawling and indexing more efficient.

➡ Why Use 304 Not Modified?

1️⃣  Improved Performance:
- Returning a 304 status can significantly reduce server load and bandwidth usage by allowing browsers and bots to use cached versions of the content.
- This can enhance page load times for users and improve the website's overall performance.

2️⃣  Efficient Use of Crawl Budget:
- For large websites with numerous pages, efficiently managing the crawl budget is vital. Search engines allocate a limited number of pages they will crawl on a site within a given period.
- By using 304 responses, you help search engines avoid wasting resources re-downloading unchanged content, allowing them to crawl and index more pages​​.

3️⃣  Enhanced User Experience:
- Users benefit from faster load times as their browsers can quickly retrieve cached content instead of waiting for the server to send the entire resource again.

➡How browsers and bots work with 304 NotModified?

1️⃣ Browsers:
- When a user revisits a webpage, the browser sends a conditional request to the server using headers like If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match.
- If the server determines that the content hasn't changed, it responds with a 304 status, prompting the browser to load the page from its cache​​.

2️⃣ Bots (Crawlers):
- Similar to browsers, search engine bots use conditional requests to check if the content has changed since their last visit.
- A 304 response tells the bot that the cached version is still valid, saving time and resources, and enabling the bot to move on to other pages​​.

➡How to enforce a browser or bot to send If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match headers?

This one is pretty simple:
1️⃣ For If-Modified-Since, add the Last-Modified response header.

2️⃣ For If-None-Match, add the ETag response header.",r/TechSEO,2024-06-27T05:36:52.000Z,post,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun Fact: A lot of devs and SEOs are trying to solve the 304 &amp;quot;error.&amp;quot; If you don&amp;#39;t believe me, search this sub. 🤐 &lt;/p&gt;

"I would appreciate your feedback on the following topic:

It's about an ecommerce website. Lately we have increased the size of the thumbnails on the PLPs to see the ""Google Image Thumbnails"" in SERP for the Category-KWs. 

Generally it worked... but in 30-40% of the cases Google is not showing one of the product-images in SERP, rather than a random thumbnail from the main navigation. (each category in the main navigation has an image/thumbnail next to the Category-Text, in an img-tag)

* the product images on the PLPs are crawlable and indexable (they are shown with site-search under the image tab)
* randomly, some of the main-navigation-thumbnails are also shown with site-search under the image tab
* based on the GSC's Inspecting Tool and on the Rich Result Tester the pages are rendered without any issue
* the width of the product thumbnails on the PLPs is between 200-250px
* the thumbnails in the main navigation (next to the Category-Text) are 45x35px small

I'm currently facing a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice from those who have dealt with a similar situation before.

I have an old 404 page on my site that has accumulated a significant number of backlinks over time. However, most of these backlinks are of low quality. I'm considering redirecting this 404 page to my homepage, but I'm unsure about the potential impact this could have.

Specifically, I'm curious about two things:

1. **Quantity vs. Quality**: Does the sheer quantity of backlinks have a positive impact, or does the low quality of these backlinks outweigh the benefits?
2. **SEO Impact**: Have you seen any noticeable changes (positive or negative) in your site's SEO performance after implementing such a redirect?

"Hey guys

So as the title says I want to get insights on a certain issue. The issue is ""Duplicate without user-selected canonical"" from search console and there are 14k errors flagged in it and all are pdfs, docs and similar files. Now from the 1000 URLs I could extract out of GSC, I have found out that some errors are because of capital letter URLs as they are conflicting with their non-capital URL counterparts.

**Scenario**  
[www.example.com/example.pdf](http://www.example.com/example.pdf)  
[www.example.com/example](http://www.example.com/example)

The same PDF is accessible with both these URLs.

* Can this be causing the issue as well?
* What do you guys follow on your websites for this specific case?
* Should I redirect the 2nd URL to the 1st URL in the situation above (won't be easy as there are around 4000 Files)?

I checked some examples by searching for PDFs in Google Search and I found two cases.

* Case 1: Accessible with and without .pdf extension
* Case 2: Getting a 404 error without the .pdf extension

Case 1

"Hi all!

First post here so hope I'm along the right lines. Recently started a new role with a company that has a completely custom built website. It's generally good but there are a few technical things that I feel are eating up crawl budget. Firstly, any index pages (for instance, our blog) is able to spawn versions using arguments (e.g. ?page=600) that have no content but don't trigger a 404. Google Search Console shows that Google is finding these 'pages', crawling them and then marking them as duplicate without a user specified canonical.

  
Is the best solution to that problem to force the system to generate a 404 when there are no posts to show? I don't want to completely no index these pages as the blog posts that are linked to are strong pieces of content.

  
Secondly. There are a number of similar pages that can be generated depending on user options (for instance, we pages for each previous version of a tool we built - these are all very similar and my instinct is to canonicalise them all to the latest version (again, Google is currently marking these pages as duplicates).

Am I on the right track here? I feel the website is currently underperforming (and have seen pages fail to be indexed for months while the Google bot happily explores a lot of non-existent content).

"I'm working on a site where three different versions of URLs are resolving:

"Hi all,

I'm working on redesigning a category tree for a client

It's a one-person business, so no developer, just the client and me.

I need to have a link to the Shop (default) page in the breadcrumbs navigation from the category pages

So that instead Home / Category it'd be Home / Shop / Category

which is the best way to do so?

Seems like there are two options:

1) adding a code snippet to add that additional link (though I haven't found an exact code to do so) and use a shop+category base for product URLs (to have the Shop link in product breadcrumbs too)

or

2) not using the default shop page, and creating a parent category to all other categories. Replace the Back to shop link in the cart page with a code snippet

"Got a technical query which I can't get to the bottom of. 

Been working in SEO for a few years in-house - largely on Wordpress sites. Recently started working on a javascript based site, which has been a fun new challenge which I've managed to get a decent handle on, there is just one small issue which I can't seem to get to the bottom of. 

GSC keeps adding a weird query string to some pretty important pages on the site. It starts by successfully indexing the proper URL, then a few days later, I find out it's indexed the page with the query string and a random value, it will sometimes deindex the proper URL for the query string URL or it will choose that page as the canonical. A few days later I'll notice that multiple variations of the value start popping up in GSC and being chosen as the canonical 

It's not sitewide, it's just on a few main pages, as well as a couple of random outliers. It's currently on our homepage which is wreaking havoc. An example of the variations on the current homepage URL:

?aa\_click=12123297218412144

?aa\_click=12125139571367293

"I run a site that has metrological averages. At present there is the main page for a location which shows the current month averages. 

From this page there are links to 12 monthly pages. The monthly pages all have a canonical pointing back to the main page.

This seemed to work OK but things have somewhat gone off a cliff over the last year.

I can see a few problems with the current approach, the main one being the massive amount of pages being generated. Looking in GSC there are 10s of thousands of crawled / discovered not indexed pages.

That said, some of the monthly pages are my most visited pages - which has made me hesitant to ditch them.

Currently I have set a no follow on the links to the monthly pages from the main page (there are still follow links deeper down). And in addition set the monthly pages on less important locations as noindex.

What I'm thinking is removing the monthly pages altogether and putting the info in a table on the main location page. This presently exists with the current month data. 

I would extend this to have links that would load other months into the table either by an AJAX fetch or revealing hidden rows from an already loaded table.

&lt;p&gt;Currently I have set a no follow on the links to the monthly pages from the main page (there are still follow links deeper down). And in addition set the monthly pages on less important locations as noindex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m thinking is removing the monthly pages altogether and putting the info in a table on the main location page. This presently exists with the current month data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would extend this to have links that would load other months into the table either by an AJAX fetch or revealing hidden rows from an already loaded table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any comments on which of these would be the best method. And how to leverage existing results for &amp;quot;average xxxxx in May&amp;quot; type search queries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

"Hello Tech SEO nerds!

I have been assigned to sort out Page Indexing Issues for my client. He runs a shopify website for coffee business. 

As per Google Search Console 90% of the pages are not indexed yet. The biggest category lies in 'Crawled - Currently Not Indexed.' In this category, some of them are blog pages too.

I ran Live Test URL for some of them and found them healthy. Some of them are referred by sitemap and other pages as well.

Your advice is required on how shall I proceed to reduce the number of affected pages? Is it due to thin quality content? Or shall I work on improving Internal Linking? How much time can this take? Can you give me a brief roadmap.

"I'm diving deep into an intriguing challenge and could use some collective wisdom. I'm working with a unique travel agency's website based in Germany, a niche player and the only one focusing 100% on their specific area. They boast a solid foundation with 80+ targeted blog articles, a well-structured site, and a longstanding web presence. Despite these strengths, the website doesn't rank within the top 50 for its main keyword on Google.

I've exhausted conventional tools to diagnose issues: Search Console, Core Web Vitals, Ahrefs, and Screaming Frog have all been deployed without revealing significant problems. Everything is indexed appropriately, and there are no glaring usability issues. Yet, I'm left puzzled.

An anomaly that caught my eye is the volume of CSS within the header when inspected via the URL Inspector in Google's Search Console. Approximately 70% of the rendered HTML comprises CSS, thanks to their use of the Astro framework and Tailwind CSS. While none of the tools explicitly flagged this as an issue, could this be a factor in their poor SERP performance?

"Can hard coding the heading tag and/or the font size have negative affects on accessibility?

For blog posts on a WordPress site, we typically use the dropdown style menu to select the style (H1, H2, paragraph, etc.) that affects the heading tag as well as the font size.

"Hello,

I work for a pretty well established sports equipment company in the UK.

We looking to do all we can to optimise for the organic product listings.

We're thinking of adding more products to the Merchant Center Feed -

\- We're thinking of upping this to 100%

Pros -  
\- More products to potentially appear in organic listings

\- Longer tail keyword benefits - show for specific long tail searches such as colours + sizes + product-name



Cons

\- Potential for more errors in feed

\- CTR may go down a bit if we are showing the most expensive options for a product - e.g. the biggest version of a product or pack size etc. when people want small or budget versions.

\- Potential dilution of focus on best-selling products5

"I've been trying to make money flipping domains and have had no luck thus far... I figured I must be doing something wrong. This conclusion was months after the fact of me realizing how unreliable our current free domain appraisal tools are that are onlinie. I may be naïve in this area but it seems the only realistic free tool is estibot.. but you're limited to two per day (per device/network).

Not only does it return an appraisal/estimate but also a quantitative output on the likelihood of the domain selling in the next 60 days is. The likelyhood of selling in the next 60 days part is something that I'm still working on the accuracy but the domain estimate in of itself seems pretty realistic.

I checked my website logbook I keep track of manually and the wordpress change log but couldn't find anything around the 23rd or 24th of July 2024.   
  
Its a `Largest Contentful Paint` issue it seems like. I thought maybe adding high priority to my header image would fix it, however, its on all the 14 pages I have so thats strange.

With that Im also seeing a high `Load Delay` on the pages.

"Hello, I'm posting here because I'm at a loss. I have a client who purchased this massive site that offers coloring pages about 2 years ago. The site got 900-1M views a month, but the site design was very outdated. And so we've made a lot of changes and UI/UX improvements as well as additional features. One of the big changes we've made was changing the URLs as advised by an ""SEO expert"" we worked with, because before the URL did not match the breadcrumbs. For example, the breadcrumb is /home/main category/subcategory/page, but the Url was :domain/pages/page-name, so we changed it to :domain/category/main-cat/subcategory/page-name

We made this change a year ago. The site numbers went down but eventually picked up after a few months.

Last December, we again made a huge addition by adding a German language. We saw about 5K after launching the additional language but encountered a lot of SEO issues like the English site showing German meta-titles and meta-descriptions. The numbers slowly dipped until the Google update around March. Seeing all this as the issues comes piling up on the site, we decided to roll back, last restore point was April 2023 which was a year ago, now we have the original version of the site, with the original URLs, and without the additional features as well as the new UI redesigned. We rolled back on March 24 (2 weeks back) and we saw a considerable spike later that day and on March 25 as well. But after that, the numbers keep on dipping. It's very hopeless. It's too painful to see the numbers. Anyone who could give any idea what have happened and what we could do to salvage the site, it would be greatly helpful.

For a performance check I have downloaded all URLs with performance from Screaming Frog, in total 1000 URLs (odd number). I have checked a few URLs from Google SERP (site: check) to verifiy whether they have prompted any clicks or impressions but none peformance according to GSC. 

Can I trust GSC that only those 1000 URLs are the ones that display some performance (and the other 4000 URLs indexed just suck and do nothing)

"Hi,

I have a range of websites (around 40+) that are all built on the exact same framework (a completely custom CMS built on PHP). I have been having issues with the sitemaps on them, many of them are working fine but around three quarters of them the sitemaps will not fetch, no matter what I do. I need to make sure the sitemaps are working so we can start to rank for rich results.

The sitemaps are dynamic and built on the same structure so I am very confused that some work and some don't - I would have thought any issues on one of them would have been the same across the board.

Originally it was around half of them working and half not. I resubmitted all of the sitemaps as just /sitemap rather than /sitemap.php and this fixed all of the problems, and all of the rich results tests were passed.

However a few days later Google recrawled the sitemaps, and around half of the newly fixed ones broke, with around half of them remaining working (more inconsistencies which again is very confusing.

I have tested all of them with third party sitemap checkers and they are returning no issues. I have also decided to try converting one of the sitemaps to XML using a sitemap generator and again this did not work.

Does anyone have any ideas what could be causing this and what I could do to fix it?

Thanks!

"Hi all, I recently built a website for a client and deployed it about a month ago. It isn't being indexed in google, bing, or duckduckgo so I'm thinking something is causing this but can't find out what the issue is. There are two 'referring pages' in google search console which I suspect are coming from a google ads campaign the company is running but they show a 'Failed: Redirect error' under the crawl on GSC. I checked the links on those sites and both work as intended so I'm not sure what is going on. Anyone have any clues to this? When I do the URL inspection in GSC everything looks good.

"So I have a pretty good above the fold page for desktop, and it's structured like this, with the main tagline and subtagline on top of a hero image: https://i.imgur.com/wz7mbZ7.png

The issue is, I am changing my website to make it more mobile friendly.  On mobile, when I use the same landing page image (with a person on the left side), I don't have much space left for the main tagline, and the sub tagline together. And on mobile, I have to shrink the font size of the main tagline, and the font size of the subtagline down, which makes it more difficult for the user to read on mobile.

I don't want to get penalized by Google, but at the same time, I have read a lot of information from forums and websites, where general design guidelines recommend that you show Google crawler the same content for your mobile and desktop website.  Some information I have read, warn you that showing different content to Google, even for mobile and desktop, risks violating Google's policy on cloaking.

Ideally, I would like to just not even render the subtagline if I my webserver detects a mobile device. I can do this with .Net, there a function Request.Browser.IsMobileDevice which I can check to see if the device is mobile or not.  If I use this function in .Net, I can easily show the subtagline for desktop, while not even rendering the subtagline for mobile.  But will this trigger the cloaking policy 
of Google and will my website be penalized for it? 

If I can't use the .Net method above to not render the subtagline on mobile because it violates Google's cloaking policies, I am down to a few options:

1. Use a different landing page image on mobile and desktop. I can use a landing page image on mobile where there is no person on the left side, thus opening up space for my subtagline.  **But if I switch the landing page image on mobile versus desktop, will that violate some Google guideline?**

2. Use CSS and use ""display: none"" or ""visibility: hidden"" on the subtagline, and using a media query for mobile devices (ie. @media only screen and (min-width: 1px) and (max-width: 833px) ). This would hide the subtagline on mobile, allowing me to make the main tagline much larger.  Based on the reading I have done, there is a possibility this may violate Google's cloaking guidelines.

3. Trying to move the subtagline to below the fold on mobile. Technically, given the structure of my website, this one is tricky, and it's a last resort for me. I prefer not to do this, but if none of the other options above are feasible, I may try this as a last resort option.

Any help would be appreciated!

"Hi everyone,

Not sure what to do with this following scenario:

Want to change URL structure to make main keywords more relevant as currently not relevant.  
  
Doing this will cause a problem because the way the site is built it means that all the breadcrumbs will be gone.

  
Along with this, there will then be 1000s of redirectrs which I think is the lesser problem but correct if wrong please.

  
My questions, is the benefit of having clear keywords in the URL structure that will be correctly internally linked across the site worth the cost of not having breadcrumbs and creating 1000s of redirects?

There doesn't seem to be a way to get verification in multiple Google Search Console accounts, however. Is this true?

Ideally, I would like to manage this entirely from my accounts (and I already have Google Analytics going + limited site admin).

Is there a way around this or should I suck it up and just use their login credentials? I'm also open to alternative solutions 🙏🙏🙏



EDIT:  To clarify, again. The Wix site is already verified in the owner's Google Search Console. HOWEVER, I want it verified and running in MY Google Search Console. Are multiple verifications in this way possible or do I have to login into THEIR Google Search Console or switch users in Wix?

"Just add text compression!


###Why Text Compression?


1️⃣ Faster Load Times:

Compressing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files can reduce the amount of data transferred between the server and the client, resulting in faster page loads.

2️⃣ Improved SEO:

Reduced load times contribute to a better user experience and lower bounce rates, which can positively impact your search engine rankings.

3️⃣ Bandwidth Savings:

Smaller file sizes mean less bandwidth usage, which is great for both users and server costs.

###Wordpress:

Go to the WordPress dashboard &gt; WP Super Cache &gt; Advanced &gt; and check the box for Compress pages.

###For frameworks:

It is literally downloading a package and few lines of code.

#####For eg. Blazor:

```
// In Program.cs

// other lines removed for brevity.

builder.Services.AddResponseCompression();

app.UseResponseCompression();
```

PS: Using brotli and gzip would be enough.

",r/TechSEO,2024-06-28T08:21:11.000Z,post,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, just asked chat gpt to summarise a load of articles about the google leaked docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably being a bit thick, but don&amp;#39;t understand if it&amp;#39;s saying the info leaked is about the Cloud, or if the Cloud itself can be used for SEO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summaries from Chat GPT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attributes in the files need to be understood and speculated upon regarding their role in ranking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second list includes modules that help developers use Google’s Cloud Platform, a suite of services for leveraging Google’s infrastructure and machine learning models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The documents, though not used in Google’s systems, are valuable for developers working with Google’s AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance of Studying These Documents:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google’s Cloud Next Keynote in April 2024 highlighted advancements in building on Google’s AI with greater confidence and accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools using Gemini can now be grounded in Google Search, reducing AI’s propensity to confabulate information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main question is whether the attributes in these API files are used in Google’s search ranking algorithms and how SEOs can utilize this information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Information for SEOs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the Attributes:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study the listed attributes as they may be signals used in Google&amp;#39;s search ranking algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example attributes include navquery (related to NavBoost), PagerankWeight (related to PageRank), and AnchorSpamPenalizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage Google&amp;#39;s Cloud Platform:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize Google’s Cloud Platform to build AI tools grounded in Google Search, ensuring accurate and reliable AI outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on integrating Gemini for enhanced AI capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor Quality Rater Mentions:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to mentions of quality raters in the API docs, as they could influence the understanding of how content quality is assessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate NavBoost:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore attributes related to NavBoost, including click data and query data, as they could provide insights into ranking factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example attributes to consider: badClicks and navquery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further exploration of the attributes mentioned in these documents will be covered in future blog posts, with a specific focus on NavBoost and its related attributes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ---------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attributes structure information for use across Google’s APIs, enabling developers to interact programmatically with Google&amp;#39;s resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some attributes may be relevant to Google’s search algorithms, though it&amp;#39;s unclear if and how they are used for ranking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples of attributes include: 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ContentAttributions:&lt;/strong&gt; Used to give credit for content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QualityTravelGoodSitesData:&lt;/strong&gt; Stores data on good travel sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IndexingMobileInterstitialsProDesktopInterstitials:&lt;/strong&gt; Related to interstitials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SpamBrainData:&lt;/strong&gt; Stores SpamBrain values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CompressedQualitySignals:&lt;/strong&gt; Used in systems like Mustang and TeraGoogle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Information for SEOs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ContentAttributions Attribute:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure proper content attribution to potentially influence ranking positively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SpamBrainData:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on reducing spam signals on your website to avoid negative impact from SpamBrain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location Attributes:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize for local search by specifying location attributes accurately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QualityTravelGoodSitesData:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For travel websites, ensure high-quality content to potentially benefit from this attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand Signals:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize that attributes can become signals within Google’s algorithms, impacting search rankings. Pay attention to aggregated and anonymized interaction data which might influence relevance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next blog post will delve into Navboost and its associated attributes, further explaining their potential impact on search rankings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attributes in Google&amp;#39;s Cloud Platform API documentation could play a role in search rankings. SEOs should focus on proper content attribution, reducing spam, optimizing for local search, and maintaining high-quality content to leverage these attributes effectively. Further insights will be provided in the next series installment discussing Navboost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how is the google cloud api important for SEO according to leaked google documents?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Importance of Google Cloud API for SEO According to Leaked Google Documents&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leaked Google documents suggest that attributes mentioned in the Google Cloud API documentation could play a significant role in search engine optimization (SEO). Here&amp;#39;s how the Google Cloud API might be important for SEO based on these documents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes as Ranking Signals:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The documents list various attributes that might be used in Google&amp;#39;s search ranking algorithms. Understanding these attributes can help SEOs optimize their content and websites to align with Google&amp;#39;s ranking factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Attributes:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ContentAttributions:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensuring proper content attribution might enhance the credibility and ranking of a webpage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SpamBrainData:&lt;/strong&gt; Reducing spam signals can improve a website’s trustworthiness and ranking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with Machine Learning Models:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google&amp;#39;s Cloud Platform APIs support machine learning models that could influence search rankings. Attributes accessible through these APIs might be part of the data used in these models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Models:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mustang:&lt;/strong&gt; Google’s primary web search index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TeraGoogle:&lt;/strong&gt; A massive search index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Signals:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attributes related to quality signals, such as &lt;strong&gt;CompressedQualitySignals&lt;/strong&gt;, indicate that Google uses various metrics to assess the quality of content. SEOs can focus on enhancing content quality to align with these signals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localized Search Optimization:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location Attributes:&lt;/strong&gt; Attributes like &amp;quot;location&amp;quot; help in optimizing content for local searches. Setting the correct locality can improve visibility in local search results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Interaction Data:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google’s algorithms use aggregated and anonymized interaction data to create signals that help determine relevance. Understanding how these signals are derived from user interactions can guide SEOs in improving user engagement and relevance of their content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spam Prevention:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attributes like &lt;strong&gt;AnchorSpamPenalizer&lt;/strong&gt; suggest that Google penalizes spammy behavior. SEOs should focus on creating authentic, high-quality content and avoid spammy practices to maintain good rankings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NavBoost-Related Data:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NavBoost Attributes:&lt;/strong&gt; Attributes related to NavBoost, such as &lt;strong&gt;navquery&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;badClicks&lt;/strong&gt;, provide insights into how Google assesses user navigation and click behavior. Optimizing for positive user interactions can potentially boost rankings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Actionable Steps for SEOs:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Attribution:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure proper attribution of content to enhance credibility and potential ranking signals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Quality:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize high-quality content creation and reduce spam indicators to align with Google’s quality signals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local SEO:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize content for local search by accurately setting location attributes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Engagement:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve user interaction metrics by enhancing website usability, relevance, and engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor and Reduce Spam:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid spammy practices and ensure the authenticity of content to prevent penalties related to spam signals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilize Cloud Platform Tools:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage Google’s Cloud Platform for advanced data analysis and machine learning integration to optimize content and understand ranking factors better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
